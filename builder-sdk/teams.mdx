In Agno, a [Team](/reference/teams/team) is a sophisticated structure comprising multiple Agents or sub-teams that collaborate to solve complex problems. Functioning like a tree, a 'team leader' at the root delegates tasks to specialized members based on their roles and capabilities. This architecture is ideal for handling multifaceted workflows that exceed a single agent's scope or context limit.

Teams preserve the core capabilities of individual agents—such as persistent memory, knowledge base access, and tool usage—while enabling hierarchical task distribution. By orchestrating specialized agents, Teams allow for modular, scalable, and efficient execution of intricate processes.

```python
from agno import Team

# Create individual agents first
agent1 = Agent(id="researcher", model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4"), db=db)
agent2 = Agent(id="writer", model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4"), db=db)

agent1.save()
agent2.save()

# Create a team
team = Team(
    id="content-team",
    name="Content Creation Team",
    members=[agent1, agent2],
    db=db
)

# Save team (creates entries in agno_component_links)
team.save()
```
