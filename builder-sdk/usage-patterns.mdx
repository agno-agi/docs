Following are some of the basic usage patterns for the Agno Agent Builder SDK.

## Pattern 1: Development Workflow

```python
# 1. Create agent
agent = Agent(id="dev-agent", model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4"), db=db)

# 2. Test locally
response = agent.run("test query")

# 3. Save when satisfied
agent.save()

# 4. Later: Load in production
prod_agent = get_agent_by_id(db=db, id="dev-agent", registry=registry)
```

## Pattern 2: Iterate on Existing Agent

```python
# Load existing agent
agent = get_agent_by_id(db=db, id="my-agent", registry=registry)

# Modify
agent.instructions = "New instructions"
agent.model = OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4-turbo")

# Save new version
agent.save()
```

## Usage Notes

<Accordion title="Note:">
    **Registry is Critical**
    - Without a registry, tools will NOT be rehydrated when loading agents
    - Always create a registry with all tools and models before loading agents
    - Tools are stored as function signatures in JSON but need live references to work

    **Database Connections**
    - Each `PostgresDb.from_dict()` creates a new connection pool
    - In v0, loading multiple agents may create multiple pools
    - This is acceptable for initial usage but may need optimization for production

    **Versioning Behavior**
    - Default `save()` uses `stage="published"` and creates immutable configs
    - Every save increments the version number automatically
    - Current version pointer updates to latest published config
