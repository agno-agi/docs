title: Conditional Workflow
description: Deterministic branching based on input analysis or business rules
---

**Example Use-Cases**: Content type routing, topic-specific processing, quality-based decisions

Conditional workflows provide predictable branching logic while maintaining deterministic execution paths.

## How It Works

The `Condition` class evaluates a function and executes different steps based on the result:

- **If branch (`steps`)**: Executes when the evaluator returns `True`
- **Else branch (`else_steps`)**: Executes when the evaluator returns `False` (optional)

If the condition is `False` and no `else_steps` are provided, the condition is skipped and the workflow continues to the next step.

## Basic Example

```python conditional_workflow.py
from agno.workflow import Condition, Step, Workflow

def is_tech_topic(step_input) -> bool:
    topic = step_input.input.lower()
    return any(keyword in topic for keyword in ["ai", "tech", "software"])

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Conditional Research",
    steps=[
        Condition(
            name="Tech Topic Check",
            evaluator=is_tech_topic,
            steps=[Step(name="Tech Research", agent=tech_researcher)]
        ),
        Step(name="General Analysis", agent=general_analyst),
    ]
)

workflow.print_response("Comprehensive analysis of AI and machine learning trends", markdown=True)
```

## If/Else Branching

Use `else_steps` to define an alternative execution path when the condition is `False`:

```python condition_with_else.py
from agno.workflow import Condition, Step, Workflow

def is_technical_issue(step_input) -> bool:
    text = (step_input.input or "").lower()
    tech_keywords = ["error", "bug", "crash", "not working", "api", "timeout"]
    return any(kw in text for kw in tech_keywords)

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Customer Support Router",
    steps=[
        Condition(
            name="TechnicalTriage",
            evaluator=is_technical_issue,
            # If branch: technical pipeline
            steps=[
                Step(name="Diagnose", agent=diagnostic_agent),
                Step(name="Engineer", agent=engineering_agent),
            ],
            # Else branch: general support
            else_steps=[
                Step(name="GeneralSupport", agent=general_support_agent),
            ],
        ),
        Step(name="FollowUp", agent=followup_agent),
    ],
)

# Technical query -> executes Diagnose, Engineer, then FollowUp
workflow.print_response("My app keeps crashing with a timeout error")

# Non-technical query -> executes GeneralSupport, then FollowUp
workflow.print_response("How do I change my shipping address?")
```
