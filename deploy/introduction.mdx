## Overview

Once you have built and configured your AgentOS locally, the next step is taking it to production. AgentOS exposes a FastAPI application under the hood, which means you are free to deploy it to any infrastructure you prefer such as Docker platforms, container services, serverless containers, Kubernetes, or a simple virtual machine.

The most reliable and convenient way to deploy a FastAPI application to production is with Docker. To make this easy, we provide ready-to-use templates for popular platforms including AWS ECS and Railway with more coming soon. If you prefer complete control, you can also turn your AgentOS into a minimal production repository with just a few files.

Here, we'll walk you through the entire process: starting from a plain Python codebase, converting it into a production-ready FastAPI service, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it to the platform of your choice.

## What you get out of the box

When you create an AgentOS locally, you automatically get a FastAPI application that exposes:

- an endpoint for running agents, teams and workflows
- endpoints for managing sessions, memories, knowledge and evals
- automatic OpenAPI and Swagger documentation
- CORS configuration
- request and error logging
- support for streaming responses
- support for multimodal inputs such as JSON or file uploads

## Preparing your Python project for deployment

A minimal AgentOS project usually looks like this:

```my-agentos
├── agents/
├── scripts/
├── pyproject.toml
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
└── app/main.py # Houses your AgentOS app
```

Your agents, teams and workflows are automatically mounted and ready to serve. As long as they are added to your AgentOS instance.

## Adding a production ready Dockerfile

Here is a minimal Dockerfile for deploying AgentOS:

```docker
FROM agnohq/python:3.12

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt pyproject.toml ./
RUN uv pip sync requirements.txt --system

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

This creates a clean, production-friendly container image.

## Testing locally

Build and run the container using the following commands from the root of your project:

Prerequisites:

- Docker installed
- Python 3.12 installed
- Agno installed

```bash
docker buildx build --load -t my-agentos .
```

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-agentos
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see your AgentOS documentation. Here you can see the endpoints for your AgentOS.

## Deployment options

You can deploy AgentOS anywhere that supports Docker containers. The most common choices are listed below.

### AWS ECS

Recommended for production deployments. Our templates provide:

• multi architecture Docker builds  
• an ECR registry  
• a Fargate service for your container  
• a load balancer with HTTPS enabled  
• integration with RDS or any managed PostgreSQL service  
• logs, health checks, and VPC networking

### Railway

A simple and fast deployment method. Railway builds your Dockerfile, provides environment variables, and gives you a public domain with HTTPS automatically.

### Fly, Render, DigitalOcean

Great for smaller or simpler deployments. These platforms accept a Dockerfile, build it, and provide hosting with minimal configuration.

## Next steps

Here, we went over how to start from scratch and build a production-ready AgentOS. But we encourage you to use one of our templates to get started faster. You can find more information about our templates [here](/deploy/templates).
