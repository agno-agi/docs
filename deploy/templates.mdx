## What are Templates?

**Templates are standardized codebases for AgentOS.** They contain:

- An AgentOS instance using FastAPI.
- A PostgreSQL database for storing sessions, memories and knowledge.

Instead of starting from scratch, you can use a template to get started and ship your AgentOS to production. They are setup to run locally using docker and on cloud providers. They're a fantastic starting point and exactly what we use for our customers. You'll definitely need to customize them to fit your specific needs, but they'll get you started much faster.

Currently supported templates:

Docker: [agent-infra-docker](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-docker)
AWS: [agent-infra-aws](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-aws)
Railway: [agent-infra-railway](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-railway)

We're working on adding more templates:

- [Modal](https://modal.com/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)

Additionally, all templates contain a dev and prd environment. The dev environment is used for development and testing. The prd environment is used for production. We recommend using docker for the dev environment for most use cases and selecting a cloud provider of your choice for the prd environment.

How to get started with a template:

1. Make sure you have the agno and agno-infra installed.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
pip install -U agno
pip install -U agno-infra
```

```bash Windows
pip install -U agno
pip install -U agno-infra
```

</CodeGroup>

Note: agno-infra library is required for the AWS template.

2. Create your codebase using: `ag infra create` and choose a template.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
ag infra create
```

```bash Windows
ag infra create
```

</CodeGroup>

3. `cd` into your codebase and run the dev environment based on the template.

4. Run the prd environment based on the template after you've tested the dev environment and are ready to deploy to production.

We recommend starting with the `agent-infra-docker` template and taking it from there.
