The Agent Infra Docker template provides a simple Docker Compose file for running AgentOS locally. It contains:

- An AgentOS instance, serving Agents, Teams, Workflows and utilities using FastAPI.
- A PostgreSQL database for storing sessions, memories and knowledge.
- A set of pre-built Agents, Teams and Workflows to use as a starting point.

Or, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions in the template documentation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-docker.git
cd agent-infra-docker
```

After creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker
