## Integrating Agno with MLflow

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) provides built-in GenAI tracing so you can capture, explore, and analyze LLM & agent traces. Agno integrates directly with MLflow via a single call to `mlflow.agno.autolog()`.

## Prerequisites


1. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure the required packages are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -U mlflow agno opentelemetry-exporter-otlp openinference-instrumentation-agno
   ```

2. **Start the MLflow tracking server**

   Start the MLflow tracking server to view traces as you run your code:

   ```bash
   mlflow server
   ```

   For more information on how to host MLflow server, see the [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/self-hosting/).


   <Tip>

   If you don't want to self-host MLflow server, you can use [Managed MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/self-hosting/#cloud-services) offered by various cloud providers.

   </Tip>

## Enable Automatic Tracing in your code

Call `mlflow.agno.autolog()` once at startup, then use your Agno agent as usual. MLflow will automatically record traces of model/tool calls and agent steps.

```python
import mlflow
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Enable MLflow tracing for Agno
mlflow.agno.autolog()

# Specify the MLflow server URL and experiment name (optional)
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("Agno Agent")

# Create and use the agent
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data. Don't include any other text.",
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("What is the stock price of Apple?", stream=False)
```

## View Traces

Access the MLflow UI to view the traces. If you started the UI locally, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser. If you are using a managed MLflow server, you can access the UI at the URL provided by the cloud provider.

</Frame>

## Notes

- Ensure your model provider credentials (for example, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are set in the environment.
- For best results, use the latest MLflow version that includes the Agno autolog integration.
