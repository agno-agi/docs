description: 5 teams showcasing content pipelines, editorial workflows, and intelligent routing.
---

Teams that actually coordinate - not just multiple agents called sequentially. Each example demonstrates real team value: parallel research, editorial pipelines, or intelligent routing.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

researcher = Agent(name="Researcher", tools=[HackerNewsTools()])
analyst = Agent(name="Analyst", tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True)])

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    mode="coordinate",
    members=[researcher, analyst],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
)

team.print_response("What tech trends are driving NVDA?", stream=True)
```
