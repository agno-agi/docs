title: Managing Tool Calls in Teams
---

This example demonstrates how to use `max_tool_calls_in_context` to limit tool calls in team context across multiple research queries.

## Code

```python forget_tool_calls.py
"""
Research Team with Context Management.

This example demonstrates a research team that uses DuckDuckGo to search the web 
and accumulate tool calls. Older research results are automatically filtered out 
to keep the context focused on recent research.

When max_tool_calls_in_context is set to 3, the team keeps only the last 3 tool call results.
