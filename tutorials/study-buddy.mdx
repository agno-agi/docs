sidebarTitle: Study Buddy Agent
description: Create an intelligent tutoring system that helps students learn effectively using Agno.
---

In this tutorial, we'll build an AI-powered study assistant that helps students learn through personalized explanations, practice questions, and adaptive learning. This agent uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to access a knowledge base and web search for current information.

**What we're using:**
- **Agno** - Framework for building agents
- **LanceDB** - Vector database for storing and retrieving educational content
- **DuckDuckGo Tools** - Web search for supplementary learning resources
- **GPT-4o** - Advanced reasoning model for educational explanations

## Prerequisites

Before we start, grab your API key:

- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

<Tip>
No additional API keys needed! This tutorial uses LanceDB (local) and DuckDuckGo (free) so you can get started with just your OpenAI key.
</Tip>

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Create project and virtual environment
mkdir study-buddy && cd study-buddy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install "agno[lancedb]" openai duckduckgo-search ddgs pandas "fastapi[standard]" uvicorn python-dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
```

Now let's create `study_buddy.py` and build it step by step.

<Note>
Steps 1-4 explain each component individually. The complete working code is in Step 5 - you can skip there if you want to run it first and learn later.
</Note>

## Step 1: Choose Your AI Model

**Which model should I use?** You can choose any model from our [supported providers](/integrations/models/openai). Models are typically chosen based on cost and performance.

**Why GPT-4o?** For educational applications, we need a model with strong reasoning and explanation capabilities.

- **Strong reasoning** - Excellent at breaking down complex concepts
- **Natural explanations** - Can adapt explanations to different learning levels
- **Teaching ability** - Good at using analogies and the Socratic method

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

load_dotenv()

model = OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o")
```

---

## Step 2: Add Knowledge Base and Tools

**Which tools should I use?** We need two key capabilities: access to educational content (knowledge base with RAG) and ability to search the web for current information.

### 2a. Setup the Knowledge Base with RAG

**What is RAG?** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows your agent to search and retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base. This ensures accurate, consistent educational content.

```python
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType
from agno.knowledge.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge

# Setup vector database for knowledge retrieval
vector_db = LanceDb(
    uri="tmp/lancedb",
    table_name="study_materials",
    search_type=SearchType.hybrid,  # Combines keyword + semantic search
    embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
)

# Create knowledge base
knowledge_base = Knowledge(vector_db=vector_db)
```

**Why hybrid search?** It combines keyword matching (finding exact terms) with semantic similarity (understanding meaning), giving better results for educational queries.

### 2b. Add Web Search Tool

**Why DuckDuckGo?** Students often need current information or supplementary resources beyond your knowledge base.

```python
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

web_search = DuckDuckGoTools()
```

---

## Step 3: Define Teaching Strategy

**Why do we need instructions?** Instructions guide how your agent approaches teaching. Without clear instructions, the agent won't know how to adapt explanations or provide effective learning support.

```python
from textwrap import dedent

instructions = dedent("""
    You are a friendly, knowledgeable Study Buddy AI tutor.

    TEACHING APPROACH:
    - Assess the student's current understanding level
    - Break complex topics into digestible chunks
    - Use examples, analogies, and visual descriptions
    - Encourage active learning through questions
    - Celebrate progress and treat mistakes as learning opportunities

    EXPLANATION FRAMEWORK:
    - Start with a simple, high-level overview
    - Provide concrete examples from everyday life
    - Use analogies to relate new concepts to familiar ones
    - Break down complex ideas step-by-step
    - End with a summary and check for understanding

    RESPONSE STYLE:
    - Be encouraging and patient
    - Use clear, accessible language
    - Show enthusiasm for learning
    - Provide practice exercises when appropriate
""")
```

**Why structure it this way?**
- **Role** - Sets the expertise level and tone
- **Teaching approach** - Guides how to break down concepts
- **Explanation framework** - Ensures consistent, clear responses
- **Response style** - Creates an encouraging learning environment

## Step 4: Create the Complete Agent

Now let's put all the pieces together:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent

study_buddy = Agent(
    name="Study Buddy",
    model=model,
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    tools=[web_search],
    instructions=instructions,
    search_knowledge=True,  # Enable RAG search
    markdown=True,
)
```

Add a function to run lessons:

```python
def start_lesson(topic: str, level: str = "beginner"):
    """Start a structured lesson on a topic."""
    prompt = f"""
    I'd like to learn about {topic}. My current level is {level}.
    
    Please:
    1. Give me an overview of the topic
    2. Explain the key concepts with examples
    3. Provide a simple practice exercise
    4. Suggest what to learn next
    """
    return study_buddy.print_response(prompt, stream=True)
```

---

## Step 5: Complete Working Code

Here's the complete `study_buddy.py`:

```python
"""Study Buddy - AI Tutoring Agent with RAG"""
from textwrap import dedent
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType
from agno.knowledge.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge

load_dotenv()

# Step 1: Choose the AI model
model = OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o")

# Step 2a: Setup knowledge base with RAG
vector_db = LanceDb(
    uri="tmp/lancedb",
    table_name="study_materials",
    search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
    embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
)

knowledge_base = Knowledge(vector_db=vector_db)

# Step 2b: Configure web search
web_search = DuckDuckGoTools()

# Step 3: Define teaching instructions
instructions = dedent("""

""")

# Step 4: Create the agent
study_buddy = Agent(
    name="Study Buddy",
    model=model,
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    tools=[web_search],
    instructions=instructions,
    search_knowledge=True,
    markdown=True,
)


async def load_study_materials():
    """Load educational content into the knowledge base."""
    print("Loading study materials...")
    
    python_basics = """
    Python Programming Fundamentals:

    Variables and Data Types:
    - Variables store data values (numbers, strings, lists)
    - Use descriptive names (user_name, not x)
    - Python is dynamically typed (no type declaration needed)

    Control Flow:
    - if/elif/else for conditional logic
    - for loops iterate over sequences
    - while loops continue until condition is False

    Functions:
    - Functions organize reusable code blocks
    - Define with def function_name(parameters):
    - Return values with return statement

    Data Structures:
    - Lists: Ordered, mutable sequences [1, 2, 3]
    - Dictionaries: Key-value pairs {"name": "John"}
    - Tuples: Ordered, immutable sequences (1, 2, 3)
    - Sets: Unordered unique values {1, 2, 3}
    """
    
    await knowledge_base.add_content_async(
        name="Python Basics",
        text_content=python_basics,
        skip_if_exists=True,
    )
    print("Study materials loaded!")


def ask(question: str):
    """Ask the Study Buddy a question."""
    return study_buddy.print_response(question, stream=True)


def start_lesson(topic: str, level: str = "beginner"):
    """Start a structured lesson on a topic."""
    prompt = f"""
    I'd like to learn about {topic}. My current level is {level}.

    3. Provide a simple practice exercise
    4. Suggest what to learn next
    """
    return study_buddy.print_response(prompt, stream=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    
    # Load knowledge base
    asyncio.run(load_study_materials())
    
    # Start a lesson
    print("\n🎓 Study Buddy is ready!\n")
    start_lesson("Python dictionaries", level="beginner")
```

**Run it:**

```bash
python study_buddy.py
```

You should see the agent load study materials, then provide a structured lesson on Python dictionaries with examples and exercises.

---

## Step 6: Deploy to AgentOS

Now let's make this production-ready with [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction). Create `my_os.py`:

```python
"""AgentOS deployment for Study Buddy"""
from textwrap import dedent
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType
from agno.knowledge.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge
from agno.os import AgentOS

load_dotenv()

# Setup knowledge base
vector_db = LanceDb(
    uri="tmp/lancedb",
    table_name="study_materials",
    search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
    embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
)

knowledge_base = Knowledge(vector_db=vector_db)

# Create agent
study_buddy = Agent(
    name="Study Buddy",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=dedent("""
        You are a friendly, knowledgeable Study Buddy AI tutor.

        When helping students:
        1. Assess their current understanding level
        2. Break complex topics into digestible chunks
        3. Use examples and analogies from everyday life
        4. Provide practice exercises
        5. Encourage and celebrate progress
    """),
    search_knowledge=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    id="study-buddy",
    description="AI Tutoring System",
    agents=[study_buddy],
)

app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="my_os:app", reload=True)
```

**What changed from the standalone script?**

| Addition | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AgentOS` wrapper | Exposes agent as REST API |
| `agent_os.serve()` | Runs the FastAPI server |

**Start it:**

```bash
python my_os.py
```

Your API is now running at `http://localhost:7777`

### Test the API

```bash
# Check the config
curl http://localhost:7777/config

# Ask a question
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/agents/study-buddy/runs \
  -F "message=Explain Python lists with examples" \
  -F "stream=false"
```

### Connect the Control Plane

For a visual dashboard:

1. Go to [agno.com/app](https://agno.com/app)
2. Click **Connect AgentOS**
3. Enter `http://localhost:7777`

Now you can chat with your agent, view session history, and monitor performance through the UI.

## Step 7: Deploy to Railway (Optional)

Want to deploy your agent to the cloud? Railway makes it easy.

### 7a. Create Requirements File

```bash
cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
agno[lancedb]
openai
duckduckgo-search
ddgs
pandas
fastapi[standard]
uvicorn
python-dotenv
EOF
```

### 7b. Create Procfile

```bash
cat > Procfile << 'EOF'
web: uvicorn my_os:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
EOF
```

### 7c. Install Railway CLI and Login

```bash
# macOS
brew install railway

# Login to Railway
railway login
```

### 7d. Initialize and Deploy

```bash
railway init
railway up
```

### 7e. Add Environment Variables

In the Railway dashboard, add your environment variable:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Once deployed, you'll get a public URL like `https://study-buddy-production.up.railway.app`.

Connect this URL to the AgentOS Control Plane at [agno.com/app](https://agno.com/app) to manage your production agent.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you built a Study Buddy agent that:

- Uses RAG to search educational content from a knowledge base
- Searches the web for supplementary learning resources
- Provides adaptive, personalized explanations
- Runs as a production API via AgentOS

The same pattern works for any educational domain - just load different content into the knowledge base and adjust the teaching instructions.
