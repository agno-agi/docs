## What You'll Build

A production-grade AgentOS deployment on AWS with:
- **ECS Fargate** for serverless container hosting
- **ECR** for container registry
- **RDS PostgreSQL** for managed database
- **Application Load Balancer** with HTTPS

AgentOS runs entirely in your cloud. The Control Plane UI connects to your deployment for testing and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for local testing
- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with appropriate permissions
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured
- An OpenAI API key

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Install tools">

Install uv and Agno:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv pip install -U "agno[infra]"
```

</Step>
<Step title="Create the project">

```bash
ag infra create
```

Select "AWS" when prompted. This creates a new `agent-infra-aws` directory.

<Tip>
Alternatively, clone directly: `git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-aws.git`
</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Set your API key">

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

</Step>
<Step title="Test locally">

Verify everything works before deploying:

```bash
ag infra up
```

Open http://localhost:8000/docs. You should see the AgentOS API documentation:

</Frame>

Stop the local environment:

```bash
ag infra down
```

</Step>
<Step title="Deploy to AWS">

```bash
ag infra up prd:aws
```

Press Enter to confirm. The deployment takes approximately 5 minutes to provision RDS, ECS, and the Load Balancer. Monitor progress in the AWS Console.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify and connect">

Once deployment completes:

1. Find your Load Balancer DNS in the AWS Console
2. Open `https://your-lb-dns/docs` to verify the API is running
3. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
4. Click "Connect OS" and select "Live"
5. Enter your Load Balancer DNS as the endpoint

## Managing Your Deployment

### Update deployment

After making changes to your agents:

```bash
ag infra patch --env prd --infra aws --name <resource-name>
```

### Stop deployment

```bash
ag infra down prd:aws
```

<Warning>
This removes all resources including the database. Ensure you have backups if needed.
</Warning>

## Cost Considerations

Estimated monthly costs (US East): $65-100/month
- ECS Fargate: $30-50
- RDS db.t3.micro: $15-20
- Load Balancer: $20-25

Use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) for detailed estimates.

## Troubleshooting

### RDS not accessible

The RDS instance takes approximately 5 minutes to become available. Check status in the AWS Console.

### ECS task failing

View task logs in CloudWatch. Common issues: missing environment variables, incorrect database connection string.
