## What You'll Build

A production AgentOS deployment on Railway with:
- AgentOS FastAPI server
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector
- Automatic HTTPS and public domain

Railway handles infrastructure management, so you can focus on building agents.

## Prerequisites

- [Railway account](https://railway.app/) (free tier available)
- An OpenAI API key

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Install tools">

Install uv, Agno, and the Railway CLI:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv pip install -U "agno[infra]"
```

<CodeGroup>
```bash Mac
brew install railway
```
```bash Windows/Linux
npm install -g @railway/cli
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Create the project">

```bash
ag infra create
```

Select "Railway" when prompted. This creates a new `agent-infra-railway` directory.

<Tip>
Alternatively, clone directly: `git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-railway.git`
</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Set your API key">

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

</Step>
<Step title="Login to Railway">

```bash
railway login
```

</Step>
<Step title="Deploy to Railway">

```bash
./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

This script creates the Railway project, provisions the database, and deploys your AgentOS.

</Step>
<Step title="Connect to AgentOS UI">

Get your Railway domain:

```bash
railway open
```

Find your domain in the Railway dashboard (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`).

Connect to the AgentOS control plane:

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
2. Click "Connect OS" and select "Live"
3. Enter your Railway domain as the endpoint

## Managing Your Deployment

### View logs

```bash
railway logs --service agent_os
```

### Update deployment

After making changes to your agents:

```bash
railway up --service agent_os -d
```

### Stop deployment

```bash
railway down --service agent_os
railway down --service pgvector
```

## Environment Variables

Set environment variables in the Railway dashboard or via CLI:

```bash
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

## Cost Considerations

Railway offers:
- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month, good for testing
- **Developer plan**: $5/month + usage, suitable for production

Check [Railway pricing](https://railway.app/pricing) for current details.

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails

Check the Railway logs:

```bash
railway logs --service agent_os
```

Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
- Docker build errors

### Database connection timeout

Railway's PostgreSQL may take a moment to provision. Wait 30 seconds and retry.
