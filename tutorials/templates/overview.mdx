Templates are production-ready codebases that get you from zero to deployed in minutes. Each template includes a configured AgentOS instance, PostgreSQL database, and deployment scripts for your target platform.

## Choose Your Template

| Template | Best For | Time | Infrastructure |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|
| [Docker](/tutorials/templates/docker) | Local development, testing, self-hosting | 5 min | Docker Compose |
| [Railway](/tutorials/templates/railway) | Quick production deployment, MVPs | 10 min | Railway (managed) |
| [AWS](/tutorials/templates/aws) | Production at scale, enterprise | 15 min | ECS, RDS, ECR |

## Decision Guide

**Use Docker if you want to:**
- Develop and test locally before deploying
- Self-host on your own infrastructure
- Deploy to any cloud provider that supports Docker

**Use Railway if you want to:**
- Deploy to production in under 10 minutes
- Avoid managing infrastructure
- Get automatic HTTPS and domain management

**Use AWS if you need:**
- Production-grade reliability and scaling
- Full control over infrastructure
- Integration with existing AWS services
