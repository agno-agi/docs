When serving agents or teams through AgentOS, you can configure pre-hooks and post-hooks to run as background tasks. This means the API response is returned immediately to the user while the hooks continue executing in the background.

## Why Use Background Tasks?

By default, hooks run synchronously and block the response:

```
Request → Pre-hooks → Agent Processing → Post-hooks → Response
                                              ↑
                                    User waits for completion
```

With background tasks enabled:

```
Request → Agent Processing → Response (immediate)
                ↓
        Pre-hooks + Post-hooks run in background
```

This is useful for:

- **Analytics and logging**: Track usage patterns without affecting response time
- **Notifications**: Send emails, Slack messages, or webhook calls
- **External API calls**: Sync data with third-party services
- **Non-critical data processing**: Tasks that don't affect the response

## Enabling Background Tasks

There are two ways to enable background execution for hooks:

### Option 1: Global Setting via AgentOS

Enable background execution for **all** hooks across all agents and teams (even as part of a workflow):

```python
from agno.os import AgentOS

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[agent],
    teams=[team],
    workflows=[workflow],
    run_hooks_in_background=True,  # All hooks run in background
)
```

When enabled, this setting automatically propagates to:
- All agents registered with AgentOS
- All teams and their member agents (including nested teams)
- All workflows and the agents/teams within their steps

See [Global Background Hooks Example](/agent-os/usage/background-hooks-global) for an example.

### Option 2: Per-Hook Setting via Decorator

Mark specific hooks to run in background using the `@hook` decorator:

```python
from agno.hooks import hook

@hook(run_in_background=True)
async def send_notification(run_output, agent):
    """Only this hook runs in the background."""
    await send_slack_message(run_output.content)
```

This approach gives you fine-grained control: critical hooks are executed during the run while non-critical hooks run in the background.

See [Per-Hook Background Example](/agent-os/usage/background-hooks-decorator) for an example.

## How It Works

AgentOS uses FastAPI's [BackgroundTasks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/) to schedule hooks for execution after the response is sent.

<Note>
Background tasks execute **sequentially** after the response is sent. If you have multiple background hooks, they run one after another.
</Note>

### Data Isolation

When hooks run in the background, AgentOS automatically creates deep copies of:

- `run_input` - The input to the agent run
- `run_context` - The current run context
- `run_output` - The output from the agent

This prevents race conditions where background hooks might accidentally modify data that's being used elsewhere.


<Warning>
**Pre- and post-hooks in background mode cannot modify the request or response.** Any modifications to `run_input` or `run_output` won't affect the agent's processing. Only use background mode for pre- and post-hooks that perform logging or monitoring. This means background mode is not suitable for Guardrails.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Background tasks require AgentOS.** When running agents directly (not through AgentOS), the `@hook(run_in_background=True)` decorator has no effect - hooks will run synchronously.
</Warning>

### Error Handling

Errors in background tasks don't affect the API response (since it's already been sent). Make sure to implement proper error handling and logging in your background hooks:

```python
@hook(run_in_background=True)
async def safe_background_hook(run_output, agent):
    try:
        await external_api_call(run_output)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Background hook failed: {e}")
```
