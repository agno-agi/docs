**AgentOS turns your Agno SDK agents into a production API ready to deploy anywhere.** 
It gives you a FastAPI-based backend for your AI product, so all you need to do is add your agent logic,
build your frontend and your product is live.

<Check>
Fully Compatible with the FastAPI Ecosystem.
AgentOS exposes the underlying FastAPI instance, allowing you to deploy custom routes, background workers, and middleware 
with zero additional configuration.
</Check>

AgentOS comprises of two parts:
1. **Runtime**: To run your Agno agents built using the Agno SDK
2. **User interface**: Visual agent builder and [control plane](/agent-os/control-plane) that lets you build, monitor, debug and deploy your agents

To use AgentOS, first instantiate and [run it](/agent-os/run-your-os) and then [connect it to the user interface](/agent-os/connect-your-os).

<Tab title="Basic AgentOS">

This is a basic AgentOS instance serving an Agent with memory, state, and MCP tools. You can monitor this agent after connecting the AgentOS to the UI.

```python agno_agent.py
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="AgentOS with Builder Components">
You can create an AgentOS instance with pre-registered components (agents, teams, workflows, tools, database, etc.).
When you connect this AgentOS to the UI, you view and use these components in the visual editor as draggable nodes for complex system design.

```python agent_os_registry.py
from agno.agent.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.registry import Registry
from agno.tools.calculator import CalculatorTools
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

db = PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai", id="postgres_db")


def sample_tool():
    return "Hello, world!"


registry = Registry(
    name="Agno Registry",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools(), sample_tool, CalculatorTools()],
    models=[
        OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5"),
        Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    ],
    dbs=[db],
)

agent = Agent(
    id="registry-agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=db,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[agent],
    id="registry-agent-os",
    registry=registry,
    db=db,
)

app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agent_os_registry:app", reload=True)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Architecture

Your AgentOS runs as a container in your cloud. The control plane connects directly from your browser. No proxy servers, no data relay.

## Private by Design

Most AI tooling stores your data on their servers. You pay retention costs, deal with egress fees, and depend on their security.

AgentOS runs entirely in your infrastructure:
- **Your database**: Sessions, memory, knowledge, traces. All stored where you control it.
- **Zero transmission**: No conversations, logs, or metrics sent to Agno.
- **Nothing stored on our end**: The control plane reads from your database, displays in your browser, stores nothing. When you close the tab, there's no trace of your data anywhere but your own systems.

See [AgentOS Security](/agent-os/security) for more details.

## AgentOS Features and Benefits

You bring in your agents and AgentOS turns them into a production-ready agentic system:
- 50+ API endpoints with SSE-compatible streaming. Ready for production on day one.
- Sessions, memory, knowledge stored in your database. Your data stays in your system.
- Request-level isolation. No state bleed between users, agents and sessions.
- JWT-based RBAC with hierarchical scopes. Enterprise-ready from day one.
- Tracing built-in, stored in your database. No third-party egress. No vendor lock-in.
- Guardrails, human in the loop, learning machines. The full Agno framework.
