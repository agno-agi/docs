AgentOS turns our agents into a production service we can deploy anywhere.

## The Problem

Frameworks help us build agents. But production is a beast of its own. Engineering teams reach for FastAPI and discover they need:
- SSE-compatible streaming that handles disconnects.
- Session persistence across containers.
- Request-level isolation so state doesn't bleed between users.
- Recovery from mid-conversation failures.
- Horizontal scaling for stateful processes.
- Authentication and authorization.

**Agents are stateful by nature. Scalable infrastructure is stateless by design.** This mismatch is one of the hardest problems in distributed systems. Every AI team solves it from scratch.

AgentOS solves it once.

## The Solution

In ~20 lines: an agent with memory, state, and MCP tools, served as a FastAPI app.
```python agno_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    tools=[MCPTools(url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agno_agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()
```

Run it, and you get:

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **REST API** | Endpoints for chat, streaming, and async runs |
| **Session Management** | Conversation history, user isolation, session persistence |
| **Knowledge Bases** | Upload documents, websites, or text. Agents search automatically |
| **Memory** | Long-term user memory across sessions |
| **Authentication** | API keys for dev, JWT + RBAC for production |
| **Recovery** | Checkpointed state, graceful failure handling |

The infrastructure layer that takes teams months to build. Live in minutes.

## Control Plane

The AgentOS comes with a built-in [control plane](https://os.agno.com) that connects directly to your runtime from your browser. Monitor sessions. Debug with full traces. Manage users and permissions.

## Private by Design

Most AI tooling has a fundamental flaw: your data lives on their servers. You pay retention costs, deal with egress fees, and hope their security is as good as yours.

AgentOS is architecturally different. Everything runs in your infrastructure.
- **Your data lives in your infrastructure**: Agents run in your cloud, data in your database.
- **Zero data transmission**: No conversations, logs, or metrics sent to Agno.
- **Nothing stored on our end**: The control plane reads from your database, displays in your browser, stores nothing, anywhere. You get complete privacy and control.

When you close the tab, there's no trace of your data anywhere but your own systems.
