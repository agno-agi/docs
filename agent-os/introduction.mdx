**AgentOS turns our multi-agent system into a FastAPI app we can deploy anywhere.**

## Example

```python agno_agent.py
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"),
    tools=[MCPTools(url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent], tracing=True)
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

This code gives us:

- 50+ API endpoints with durable SSE streaming.
- Sessions, memory, knowledge stored in your database.
- Request-level isolation. No state bleed.
- JWT-based RBAC with hierarchical scopes.
- Tracing built-in, stored in your database.
- Guardrails, human in the loop, learning machines, the full Agno framework.

In ~20 lines: an Agent with memory, state, and MCP tools, served as a FastAPI application.

## Control Plane

The AgentOS comes with a built-in [control plane](https://os.agno.com) that connects directly to your runtime from your browser. Monitor sessions. Debug with full traces. Manage users and permissions.

## Private by Design

Most AI tooling has a fundamental flaw: your data lives on their servers. You pay retention costs, deal with egress fees, and hope their security is as good as yours.

AgentOS is architecturally different. Everything runs in your infrastructure.
- **Your data lives in your infrastructure**: Agents run in your cloud, data in your database.
- **Zero data transmission**: No conversations, logs, or metrics sent to Agno.
- **Nothing stored on our end**: The control plane reads from your database, displays in your browser, stores nothing, anywhere. You get complete privacy and control.

When you close the tab, there's no trace of your data anywhere but your own systems.

## Architecture

AgentOS is architecturally different. Everything runs in your infrastructure:
- Your AgentOS runs as a container in your cloud
- Your data is stored in your database (sessions, memory, knowledge, traces)
- The control plane connects directly to your AgentOS from your browser
