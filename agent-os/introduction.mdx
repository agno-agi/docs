**AgentOS turns your agents into an AI service you can deploy anywhere.**

You bring the agents and AgentOS turns it into a product:
- 50+ API endpoints with SSE-compatible streaming. Ready for production on day one.
- Sessions, memory, knowledge stored in your database. Your data lives in your database.
- Request-level isolation. No state bleed between users, agents and sessions.
- JWT-based RBAC with hierarchical scopes. Enterprise-ready from day one.
- Tracing built-in, stored in your database. No third-party egress. No vendor lock-in.
- Guardrails, human in the loop, learning machines. The full Agno framework.

Here's an example of an AgentOS serving an Agent with memory, state, and MCP tools:

```python agno_agent.py
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"),
    tools=[MCPTools(url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent], tracing=True)
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

AgentOS runs on FastAPI. Add middleware, custom routes, background tasks, or any FastAPI feature without extra configuration.

## Control Plane

The AgentOS also comes with a built-in [control plane](https://os.agno.com) that connects directly to your runtime from your browser. Monitor sessions. Debug with full traces. Manage users and permissions.

## Private by Design

Most AI tooling has a fundamental flaw: your data lives on their servers. You pay retention costs, deal with egress fees, and hope their security is as good as yours.

AgentOS is architecturally different. Everything runs in your infrastructure.
- **Your data lives in your database**: Agents run in your cloud, data in your database.
- **Zero data transmission**: No conversations, logs, or metrics sent to Agno.
- **Nothing stored on our end**: The control plane reads from your database, displays in your browser, stores nothing, anywhere. You get complete privacy and control.

When you close the tab, there's no trace of your data anywhere but your own systems.

## Architecture

AgentOS is architecturally different. Everything runs in your infrastructure:
- Your AgentOS runs as a container in your cloud
- Your data is stored in your database (sessions, memory, knowledge, traces)
- The control plane connects directly to your AgentOS from your browser
