Drag, drop, and orchestrate Agents, Teams, and Workflows on a live canvas to deploy production-ready agentic systems with AgentOS Studio.

## Concepts

| Concept                                 | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Agents](/agent-os/studio/agents)       | Build and configure agents with models, tools, and instructions                     |
| [Teams](/agent-os/studio/teams)         | Compose multi-agent teams with coordination modes                                   |
| [Workflows](/agent-os/studio/workflows) | Design step-based workflows with conditions, loops, routers, and parallel execution |
| [Registry](/agent-os/studio/registry)   | Browse and manage registered tools, models, databases, and schemas                  |

## How It Works

Studio connects to your running AgentOS instance and uses a Registry to populate available components.
Build visually, test interactively, and publish when ready.

1. Register your components in a `Registry`
2. Pass the registry **and a database** to `AgentOS`
3. Open Studio in the control plane to start building

```python
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.registry import Registry
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.websearch import WebSearchTools

# Database connection - required for Studio's /components endpoints
db = PostgresDb(db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai")

registry = Registry(
    name="My Registry",
    tools=[WebSearchTools()],
    models=[OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini")],
    dbs=[db],
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    id="my-app",
    db=db,  # Required for Studio to work
    registry=registry,
)

app = agent_os.get_app()
```

<Warning> The `db` parameter is required for Studio's `/components` API endpoints to be available. Without it, Studio cannot save or load agents, teams, and workflows.</Warning>

## Development Lifecycle

Studio manages the full development lifecycle from building to deploying complex agentic systems with AgentOS components.

### 1. Build

Create your agent, team, or workflow using the visual builder. Drag components from the Registry, configure properties, and wire everything together.

### 2. Save Draft

Save your work as a draft version. Drafts are not accessible via the API but can be tested, restored, and published later. You can save multiple draft versions to checkpoint your progress.

### 3. Test

Once saved, test your draft in the AgentOS Control Plane:

- **Chat Page**: Interact with your agent, team, or workflow in real-time
- **View Traces**: Inspect tool calls, model responses, and reasoning for each run
- **Debug Mode**: Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues

<Warning>
  Before publishing, test and make sure your agent handles edge cases and
  unexpected inputs gracefully.
</Warning>

### 4. Publish

Move from draft to production with one click. Publish the visual blueprint of your agentic system after verification.
Manage multiple versions of your system blueprint. Every published version is immediately
accessible via a unique API endpoint. Set any version as _Current_ to make it the default for your production API.

### 5. Manage Versions

Access the full version history for any agent, team, or workflow:

- **Restore**: Load any previous version into the editor
- **Set Current**: Choose which published version is used by default when running via the API
- **Delete**: Remove old versions you no longer need

<Tip>
  Use descriptive version labels like `v1.2-improved-instructions` or
  `before-refactor` to make it easy to identify versions later.
</Tip>
