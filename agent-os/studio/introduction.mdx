**AgentOS Studio is a visual editor for building Agents, Teams, and Workflows**

## Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Agents](/agent-os/studio/agents) | Build and configure agents with models, tools, and instructions |
| [Teams](/agent-os/studio/teams) | Compose multi-agent teams with coordination modes |
| [Workflows](/agent-os/studio/workflows) | Design step-based workflows with conditions, loops, routers, and parallel execution |
| [Registry](/agent-os/studio/registry) | Browse and manage registered tools, models, databases, and schemas |

## How It Works

Studio connects to your running AgentOS instance and uses the Registry to populate available components. Build visually, test interactively, and publish when ready.

1. Register your components (tools, models, databases) in a `Registry`
2. Pass the registry to `AgentOS`
3. Open Studio in the control plane to start building

```python
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.registry import Registry
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.websearch import WebSearchTools

registry = Registry(
    name="My Registry",
    tools=[WebSearchTools()],
    models=[OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini")],
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    id="my-app",
    registry=registry,
)

app = agent_os.get_app()
```

## Development Lifecycle

Studio provides a complete development lifecycle for your agents, teams, and workflows:

### 1. Build

Create your agent, team, or workflow using the visual builder. Drag components from the Registry, configure properties, and wire everything together.

### 2. Save Draft

Save your work as a draft version. Drafts are not accessible via the API but can be tested, restored, and published later. You can save multiple draft versions to checkpoint your progress.

### 3. Test

Once saved, test your draft in the AgentOS Control Plane:

- **Chat Page**: Interact with your agent, team, or workflow in real-time
- **View Traces**: Inspect tool calls, model responses, and reasoning for each run
- **Debug Mode**: Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues

<Tip>
Test with edge cases and unexpected inputs to ensure your agent handles them gracefully before publishing.
</Tip>

### 4. Publish

When you're confident in your draft, publish it to make it live. Published versions are accessible via the API and can be set as the current version.

You can have multiple draft and published versions. Iterate with drafts, then publish when ready for production.

### 5. Manage Versions

Access the full version history for any agent, team, or workflow:

- **Restore**: Load any previous version into the editor
- **Set Current**: Choose which published version is used by default when running via the API
- **Delete**: Remove old versions you no longer need

<Tip>
Use descriptive version labels like `v1.2-improved-instructions` or `before-refactor` to make it easy to identify versions later.
</Tip>
