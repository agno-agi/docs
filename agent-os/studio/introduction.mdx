**AgentOS Studio is a visual editor for building Agents, Teams, and Workflows**

## Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Agents](/agent-os/studio/agents) | Build and configure agents with models, tools, and instructions |
| [Teams](/agent-os/studio/teams) | Compose multi-agent teams with coordination modes |
| [Workflows](/agent-os/studio/workflows) | Design step-based workflows with conditions, loops, routers, and parallel execution |
| [Registry](/agent-os/studio/registry) | Browse and manage registered tools, models, databases, and schemas |

## How It Works

Studio connects to your running AgentOS instance and uses the Registry to populate available components. Build visually, test interactively, and publish when ready.

1. Register your components (tools, models, databases) in a `Registry`
2. Pass the registry to `AgentOS`
3. Open Studio in the control plane to start building

```python
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.registry import Registry
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.websearch import WebSearchTools

registry = Registry(
    name="My Registry",
    tools=[WebSearchTools()],
    models=[OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini")],
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    id="my-app",
    registry=registry,
)

app = agent_os.get_app()
```

## Development Lifecycle

Studio provides a complete development lifecycle for your agents, teams, and workflows:

### 1. Build

Create your agent, team, or workflow using the visual builder. Drag components from the Registry, configure properties, and wire everything together. Every change you make is auto-saved as a **draft**.

### 2. Save Versions

When you're ready to checkpoint your work, **save a version**:

- Click **Save Version** in the toolbar
- Add a version label (e.g., `v1.0`, `beta`, `experiment-rag`)
- Optionally add notes describing the changes

Versions are immutable snapshots of your configuration. You can create as many versions as you need during development.

<Tip>
Use descriptive version labels like `v1.2-improved-instructions` or `before-refactor` to make it easy to identify versions later.
</Tip>

### 3. Update Versions

Continue iterating on your draft after saving a version:

- Make changes to your agent, team, or workflow
- Test the changes (see below)
- Save a new version when ready

You can also **restore** any previous version to continue working from that point. This makes it safe to experiment—you can always roll back.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Save Version** | Create a new immutable snapshot |
| **Restore Version** | Load a previous version into the editor as a new draft |
| **Compare Versions** | View diff between two versions |
| **Delete Version** | Remove an old version (published versions cannot be deleted) |

### 4. Test

Before publishing, test your work directly in Studio:

- **Chat Page**: Interact with your agent or team in real-time
- **Run Workflow**: Execute workflows with sample inputs and watch step-by-step execution
- **View Traces**: Inspect tool calls, model responses, and reasoning for each run
- **Debug Mode**: Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues

<Tip>
Test with edge cases and unexpected inputs to ensure your agent handles them gracefully before publishing.
</Tip>

### 5. Publish

Once you're confident in your version, **publish** it to make it available for production use:

- Select the version you want to publish
- Click **Publish**
- Confirm the publish action

Published versions become available via the AgentOS API and can be used by other applications. Only one version can be published at a time per agent, team, or workflow.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress, auto-saved, not accessible via API |
| **Saved Version** | Immutable snapshot, can be restored or published |
| **Published** | Live version accessible via API and other applications |

### Version History

Access the full version history for any agent, team, or workflow:

- View all saved versions with timestamps and labels
- See which version is currently published
- Restore, compare, or delete versions
- Track who made changes and when (with team accounts)
