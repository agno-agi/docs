Studio provides a **visual Team Builder** for composing multi-agent teams with coordination modes. 
No code required. Drag agents onto the canvas, configure coordination, and run teams.

## Creating Teams

Create a new team by dragging agents from your [Registry](/agent-os/studio/registry) and configuring the team settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Members** | Drag and drop agents to include in the team |
| **Mode** | Coordination mode: `coordinate`, `route`, or `collaborate` |
| **Instructions** | Team-level instructions for the leader agent |
| **Success Criteria** | Define when the team's task is complete |

<Tip>
Agents can be created directly in Studio or registered via code—both are available for team composition.
</Tip>

## Using Teams

Teams built in Studio can be used in multiple ways:

- **Chat directly** with the team via the Chat page
- **Use in Workflows** as step executors for complex automation

## Save and Run

Once your team is configured:

1. **Save** your team to persist it to the registry
2. Navigate to the **Chat page** to interact with your team
3. Send tasks and watch agents collaborate in real-time
4. View individual agent contributions and coordination flow

## Code Equivalent

A team instance created in Studio directly maps to the SDK `Team` class:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.websearch import WebSearchTools

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[WebSearchTools()],
    instructions="Research topics thoroughly.",
)

hn_analyst = Agent(
    name="HN Analyst",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    instructions="Find relevant HackerNews discussions.",
)

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    mode="coordinate",
    members=[researcher, hn_analyst],
    instructions="Coordinate research across web and HackerNews.",
)
```
