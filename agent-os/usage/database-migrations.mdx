You can expect the schemas in your AgentOS database tables to be stable across versions.

However, in future versions, we may occasionally update or add new columns or tables.

If you need to apply migrations, you can do so via the AgentOS API.

## Applying Migrations

There are two endpoints you can use to apply migrations:

- `POST /databases/all/migrate`: to migrate all tables in all databases.
- `POST /databases/{db_id}/migrate`: to migrate all tables in the given database.

Both endpoints will by default migrate tables to the latest version.

You can also specify the version you want to migrate too, by specifying the `target_version` query parameter.

## How migrations work

The migrations are handled by the `MigrationManager` class. You can read more about it in the [Database Migrations](/basics/database/migrations) page.
