## Overview

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) in AgentOS enables agents to pause execution and require human approval or input before critical operations proceed. This is useful for validating sensitive operations, reviewing tool calls, and gathering user input during agent execution.

<Note>
  <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Your AgentOS must be connected and active. HITL is currently supported for agents.
</Note>

## How It Works

When an agent encounters a tool requiring confirmation or user input, the run automatically pauses with status `"paused"`. The run can then be continued programmatically via the AgentOS API after human review.

### Setting Up HITL Tools

Mark tools that require confirmation before execution:

```python
from agno.tools import tool

@tool(requires_confirmation=True)
def delete_records(table_name: str, count: int) -> str:
    """Delete records from a database table."""
    return f"Deleted {count} records from {table_name}"
```

For complete setup and usage examples, see the [HITL Example](/examples/agent-os/hitl).

## Managing Paused Runs

Paused runs can be monitored and continued through the AgentOS API. When a run is paused, it returns status `"paused"` along with tool details requiring confirmation.

For detailed API usage and examples, see the [HITL Example](/examples/agent-os/hitl).
