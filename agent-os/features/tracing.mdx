## Overview

The Tracing feature in AgentOS provides deep observability into your agent and team executions. Every run generates a trace containing detailed information about what happened, how long it took, and what resources were used.

- Traces capture the complete execution flow of agents and teams
- Each trace contains spans representing individual operations (LLM calls, tool executions, etc.)
- View token usage, latency, and error information at a glance
- Filter and search traces to debug issues or analyze performance

<Note>
  <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Your AgentOS must be connected and active with tracing enabled. If
  you see "Disconnected" or "Inactive," review your{" "}
