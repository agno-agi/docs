**Knowledge** gives agents access to information beyond their training data. Load files, URLs, or raw text, and agents can search this knowledge to provide accurate, contextual responses.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge
from agno.vectordb.chroma import ChromaDb

# Create a knowledge base
knowledge = Knowledge(
    vector_db=ChromaDb(collection="docs", path="tmp/chromadb"),
)

# Load content
knowledge.insert(url="https://docs.agno.com/introduction.md")

# Create an agent that searches the knowledge base
agent = Agent(knowledge=knowledge, search_knowledge=True)
agent.print_response("What is Agno?")
```

The agent searches its knowledge base and grounds its response in the content.

## How It Works

Knowledge combines three components:

1. **Content ingestion**: Read documents from files, URLs, cloud storage, or raw text. Agno includes readers for PDF, DOCX, CSV, Markdown, and more.

2. **Chunking and embedding**: Documents are split into searchable chunks and converted to vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.

3. **Search and retrieval**: When an agent needs information, it searches the vector database for relevant chunks and includes them in its context.

You can use **Agentic RAG** (agent decides when to search) or **Traditional RAG** (always inject context). Agentic RAG is the default and works well for most use cases.

## Why Knowledge Matters

Language models have broad general knowledge but lack context about your specific domain. Knowledge bridges this gap by providing relevant information at runtime.

**Start with your content.** Load company documentation, database schemas, product specs, support FAQs, or research papers. The agent uses this information to answer questions accurately instead of guessing.

**Then let agents learn.** Knowledge isn't read-only. Agents can save insights they discover and retrieve them later, building expertise across conversations.

```python
def save_learning(title: str, insight: str) -> str:
    """Save a reusable insight to the knowledge base."""
    knowledge.insert(name=title, text_content=insight)
    return f"Saved: {title}"

agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge,
    search_knowledge=True,
    tools=[save_learning],  # Agent can write to knowledge
)
```

This turns agents from static systems into systems that learn over time.

## Vector Stores

Agno supports 20+ vector databases, from local options like LanceDB and ChromaDB to managed services like Pinecone and Weaviate.
