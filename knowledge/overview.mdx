**Knowledge** gives agents access to information beyond their training data. Load knowledge from files, URLs, or text, and agents can search this knowledge to provide accurate, contextual responses.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge
from agno.vectordb.chroma import ChromaDb

# Create a knowledge base
knowledge = Knowledge(
    vector_db=ChromaDb(collection="docs", path="tmp/chromadb"),
)

# Load content
knowledge.insert(url="https://docs.agno.com/introduction.md")

# Create an agent that searches the knowledge base
agent = Agent(knowledge=knowledge, search_knowledge=True)
agent.print_response("What is Agno?")
```

The agent automatically searches the knowledge base when relevant and grounds its response in your content.

## Why Knowledge Matters

LLMs have broad general knowledge but lack context about your specific domain. Knowledge bridges this gap by letting you inject relevant information at query time.

Typical use cases include company documentation (HR policies, product specs, onboarding guides), database schemas for text-to-SQL, customer support FAQs, research papers, and any specialized information your agents need to reference.

## How It Works

Knowledge combines three components:

1. **Content ingestion**: Read documents from files, URLs, cloud storage, or raw text. Agno includes readers for PDF, DOCX, CSV, Markdown, and more.

2. **Chunking and embedding**: Documents are split into searchable chunks and converted to vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.

3. **Search and retrieval**: When an agent needs information, it searches the vector database for relevant chunks and includes them in its context.

You can use **agentic RAG** (agent decides when to search) or **traditional RAG** (always inject context). Agentic RAG is the default and works well for most use cases.

## Supported Vector Databases

Agno supports 20+ vector databases. Run locally with LanceDB or ChromaDB, use PostgreSQL with pgvector, or connect to managed services like Pinecone or Weaviate.
