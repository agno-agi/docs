## What is Agno?

**A framework for building multi-agent systems that learn and improve with every interaction.**

Most agents are stateless. They reason, respond, forget. Session history helps, but they're exactly as capable on day 1000 as they were on day 1.

Agno agents are different. They remember users across sessions, accumulate knowledge across conversations, and learn from decisions. Insights from one user benefit everyone. The system gets smarter over time.

Everything runs in your cloud. Your data never leaves your environment.

## Quick Example

```python {8}
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db"),
    learning=True,
)
```

One line. Now your agent remembers users, accumulates knowledge, and improves over time.

## Production Stack

Agno provides the complete infrastructure for building multi-agent systems that learn:

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Framework** | Build agents and multi-agent teams with learning, tools, knowledge, and guardrails |
| **Runtime** | Run your system in production using the [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) |
| **Control Plane** | Monitor and manage via the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) |
