## What is Agno?

Agno is a framework, runtime, and control plane for multi-agent systems.

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **Framework** | Build agents, teams, and workflows with memory, knowledge, guardrails, and 100+ integrations. |
| **AgentOS Runtime** | Run your system in production as a stateless, secure FastAPI application. |
| **Control Plane** | Manage and monitor your system using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com). |

## Why Agno?

Running multi-agent systems as a secure, scalable service is a hard, distributed systems problem. Most teams cobble together LLM calls, custom orchestration, and third-party monitoring tools.

Agno replaces that patchwork with a unified platform that runs entirely in your cloud. No data leaves your environment, making it ideal for security-conscious teams.

## Quick Example

Here's an agent that connects to an MCP server, persists conversation state, and is served via FastAPI:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    tools=[MCPTools(url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agno_agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

Run this script and connect to the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) to chat with your agent:
