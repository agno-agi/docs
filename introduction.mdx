Agno provides the complete stack for building, running, and managing multi-agent systems.

- **Framework** for building agents, teams and workflows.
- **Runtime** for running agents, teams and workflows in production.
- **Control Plane** for testing, monitoring and managing your system.

## Agno Framework - SDK for Multi-Agent Systems

The Agno Framework is a high-performance SDK for building:

- **Agents** with memory, knowledge, session management, and advanced features like human-in-the-loop, guardrails, context compression, MCP and A2A support.
- **Multi-Agent Teams** that operate autonomously under a team leader that maintains state and context. Perfect for use cases where the scope exceeds beyond a single agent.
- **Step-based Workflows** for controlled, deterministic execution. Run Agents, Teams (or regular python functions) sequentially, in parallel, in loops, or conditional branches.

These primitives give you a complete set of tools for building your multi-agent system. Agno also provides a ready-to-use FastAPI app for running your multi-agent system in production, called the **AgentOS**.

## AgentOS - Production Runtime for Multi-Agent Systems

Building Agents is easy, running them is hard, and that's where the AgentOS comes in. AgentOS is a high-performance runtime for serving multi-agent systems in production. Key features include:

1. **Pre-built FastAPI app**: AgentOS ships with a ready-to-use FastAPI app for running your agents, teams, and workflows in production. This gives you a major head start in building your AI product.

2. **Integrated Control Plane**: The [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) connects directly to your runtime, letting you test, monitor, and manage your system in real time, giving you unmatched control over your system.

3. **Private & Secure**: AgentOS runs securely in your cloud and all data (sessions, traces) is stored in your database. It comes with first-class support for RBAC, JWT authentication and security keys.

## Example

Here’s an example of an Agent that connects to an MCP server, manages session history in a database, and is served using a FastAPI app that you can chat with using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

<Tip>

Swap the database to Postgres and you have a production-ready agent in 25 lines of code.

```python agno_agent.py lines
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

# ************* Create Agent *************
agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    tools=[MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# ************* Create AgentOS *************
agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agno_agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

# ************* Run AgentOS *************
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

Here's what the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) looks like in action:

## The Complete Agentic Solution

Agno provides the complete solution for companies building multi-agent systems:

- The fastest framework for building agents, multi-agent teams and agentic workflows.
- A ready-to-use FastAPI app that gets you building AI products on day one.
- A control plane for testing, monitoring and managing your system.

Agno introduces a novel architecture that no other framework provides: your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it from your browser. You don't need to send data to any external services or store data in multiple places, you get complete privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, follow the [quickstart](/introduction/quickstart) to build your first Agent and run it using the AgentOS.

After that, checkout the [use-cases gallery](/examples/use-cases/overview) and build real-world applications with Agno.
