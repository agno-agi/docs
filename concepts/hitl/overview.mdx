Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) in Agno enables you to implement patterns where human oversight and input are required during agent execution. This is crucial for:

- Validating sensitive operations
- Reviewing tool calls before execution
- Gathering user input for decision-making
- Managing external tool execution

## Types of Human-in-the-Loop

Agno supports four main types of human-in-the-loop flows:

1. **[User Confirmation](/concepts/hitl/user-confirmation)**: Require explicit user approval before executing tool calls
2. **[User Input](/concepts/hitl/user-input)**: Gather specific information from users during execution
3. **[Dynamic User Input](/concepts/hitl/dynamic-user-input)**: Have the agent collect user input as it needs it
4. **[External Tool Execution](/concepts/hitl/external-execution)**: Execute tools outside of the agent's control

<Note>
Currently Agno only supports user control flows for `Agent`. `Team` and `Workflow` will be supported in the near future!
</Note>

## Resuming Agent Execution

Human-in-the-loop flows interrupt the agent's execution and require human oversight. The run can then be continued by calling the `continue_run` method.

For example:

```python
run_response = agent.run("Perform sensitive operation")

if run_response.is_paused:
    # The agent has paused and is awaiting human input
    # ... perform other tasks, update the tools if needed

    # Continue the run after providing the necessary input
    response = agent.continue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, updated_tools=run_response.tools)
    # or response = await agent.acontinue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, updated_tools=run_response.tools)
```

The `continue_run` method continues with the state of the agent at the time of the pause. You can also pass the `RunOutput` of a specific run to the `continue_run` method, or pass the `run_id` and list of updated tools in the `updated_tools` parameter.

## Best Practices

1. **Sanitize user input**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities
2. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling for user input and external calls
3. **Input validation**: Validate user input before processing
