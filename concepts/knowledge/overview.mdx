sidebarTitle: Overview
description: Understand why Knowledge is essential for building intelligent, context-aware AI agents that provide accurate, relevant responses.
---

Imagine asking an AI agent about your company's HR policies, and instead of generic advice, it gives you precise answers based on your actual employee handbook. Or picture a customer support agent that knows your specific product details, pricing, and troubleshooting guides. This is the power of Knowledge in Agno.

## The Problem with Knowledge-Free Agents

Without access to specific information, AI agents can only rely on their general training data. This leads to:

- **Generic responses** that don't match your specific context
- **Outdated information** from training data that's months or years old
- **Hallucinations** when the agent guesses at facts it doesn't actually know
- **Limited usefulness** for domain-specific tasks or company-specific workflows

## What Knowledge Brings to Your Agents

Knowledge transforms your agents from generic assistants into specialized experts by giving them access to:

## Real-World Impact

### Intelligent Text-to-SQL Agents
Build agents that know your exact database schema, column names, and common query patterns. Instead of guessing at table structures, they retrieve the specific schema information needed for each query, ensuring accurate SQL generation.

### Customer Support Excellence
Create a support agent with access to your complete product documentation, FAQ database, and troubleshooting guides. Customers get accurate answers instantly, without waiting for human agents to look up information.

### Internal Knowledge Assistant
Deploy an agent that knows your company's processes, policies, and institutional knowledge. New employees can get onboarding help, and existing team members can quickly find answers to complex procedural questions.

## The Knowledge Advantage

When you enable Knowledge in your Agno agents:

✅ **Agents become experts** in your specific domain
✅ **Responses include sources** for verification and trust
