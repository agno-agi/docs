**Team tools are shared across all agents in a team, enabling coordinated multi-agent workflows**.

Unlike [agent-level tools](/concepts/tools/agent) where each agent has its own set of tools, team tools are accessible by every member of the team. This is powerful for multi-agent systems where:

- **Multiple agents need the same capabilities** - Configure once, all agents can use it
- **You want consistent behavior** - Same tool configuration across all team members
- **Agents need to collaborate** - Multiple agents can work with the same tools on shared tasks

For example, in a research team with a Searcher agent and a Summarizer agent, both can access the same web search tool at the team level:

```python
from agno.team import Team

team = Team(
    members=[searcher, summarizer],  # Both can access team tools
    tools=[...],  # Shared tools
)
```

## How Team Tools Work

When you add tools to a team:
1. **All agents inherit access** - Every team member can call the team tools
2. **Individual agents can have their own tools too** - Combine team-level and agent-level tools
3. **Tools are called by whichever agent needs them** - The LLM decides which agent should use which tool

This is different from adding the same tools to each agent individually - with team tools, you configure once and maintain in one place.

## Using a Toolkit

Agno provides many pre-built **toolkits** that you can add to your Teams. For example, let's use the DuckDuckGo toolkit to create a team that can search the web.

<Tip>
  You can find more toolkits in the [Toolkits](/concepts/tools/toolkits) guide.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new file">
    Create a file `web_search_team.py`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add code to file">
    ```python web_search_team.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

    web_agent = Agent(
        name="Web Searcher",
        role="Search the web for information",
    )

    team = Team(
        members=[web_agent],
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        markdown=True,
    )

    team.print_response("What's happening in France?", stream=True)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Snippet file="create-venv-step.mdx" />

  <Step title="Install libraries">
    ```shell
    pip install openai ddgs agno
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set OpenAI Key">
    <Snippet file="set-openai-key.mdx" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the team">
    ```shell
    python web_search_team.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing your own Tools

For more control, write your own Python functions and add them as tools to a Team. Here's an example showing how team tools enable collaboration between multiple agents:

```python customer_support_team.py
import json
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team

# Shared tool that both agents can use
def get_customer_data(customer_id: str) -> str:
    """Fetch customer information from the database.

    Args:
        customer_id (str): The customer ID to look up.
    """
    # Simulate database lookup
    customers = {
        "C001": {"name": "Alice Smith", "tier": "premium", "open_tickets": 2},
        "C002": {"name": "Bob Johnson", "tier": "standard", "open_tickets": 0},
    }
    return json.dumps(customers.get(customer_id, {"error": "Customer not found"}))

def send_email(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    """Send an email to a customer.

    Args:
        recipient (str): Customer email or ID
        subject (str): Email subject
        body (str): Email content
    """
    # Simulate sending email
    return f"Email sent to {recipient}: {subject}"

# Create specialized agents
lookup_agent = Agent(
    name="Customer Lookup Agent",
    role="Look up customer information and ticket status",
)

response_agent = Agent(
    name="Response Agent",
    role="Draft and send customer responses based on their information",
)

# Both agents can access team tools
team = Team(
    members=[lookup_agent, response_agent],
    tools=[get_customer_data, send_email],  # Shared across all agents
    markdown=True,
)

team.print_response(
    "Customer C001 is asking about their open tickets. Look them up and send them an update.",
    stream=True,
)
```

In this example:
- **lookup_agent** uses `get_customer_data` to find customer info
- **response_agent** uses the same customer data and calls `send_email`
- Both agents collaborate using the shared team tools
