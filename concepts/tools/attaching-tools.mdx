Tools can be added to Agents and Teams after they've been created. This gives you the flexibility to dynamically manage tools at runtime based on conditions, user input, or application state.

## When to Use Dynamic Tool Management

Use `add_tool()` and `set_tools()` when you need to:

**Conditional tool access:**
- Grant tools based on user authentication level (e.g., admin vs. regular user)
- Enable tools after certain workflow steps complete
- Add tools based on user preferences or subscription tier

**Runtime flexibility:**
- Load tools dynamically from plugins or extensions
- Add tools based on conversation context
- Enable experimental features for beta users

**State-dependent capabilities:**
- Add payment tools only after user verification
- Enable database tools after connection is established
- Provide region-specific tools based on user location

## How It Works

- **`add_tool(tool)`** - Adds a single tool to existing tools (doesn't remove others)
- **`set_tools([tools])`** - Replaces ALL existing tools with the provided list

<Warning>
`set_tools()` removes any previously assigned tools. Use `add_tool()` if you want to keep existing tools and add new ones.
</Warning>

## Agent Example

Create your own tool, for example `get_weather`. Then call `add_tool` to attach it to your Agent.

```python add_agent_tool_post_initialization.py
import random

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools import tool


@tool(stop_after_tool_call=True)
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather for a city."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    weather_conditions = ["sunny", "cloudy", "rainy", "snowy", "windy"]
    random_weather = random.choice(weather_conditions)

    return f"The weather in {city} is {random_weather}."


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response("What can you do?", stream=True)

agent.add_tool(get_weather)

agent.print_response("What is the weather in San Francisco?", stream=True)
```

# Team Example

Create a list of tools, and assign them to your Team with `set_tools`

```python add_team_tool_post_initialization.py
import random

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team.team import Team
from agno.tools import tool
from agno.tools.calculator import CalculatorTools


agent1 = Agent(
    name="Stock Searcher",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
)

agent2 = Agent(
    name="Company Info Searcher",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
)

team = Team(
    name="Stock Research Team",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
    members=[agent1, agent2],
    tools=[CalculatorTools()],
    markdown=True,
    show_members_responses=True,
)


@tool
def get_stock_price(stock_symbol: str) -> str:
    """Get the current stock price of a stock."""
    return f"The current stock price of {stock_symbol} is {random.randint(100, 1000)}."

@tool
def get_stock_availability(stock_symbol: str) -> str:
    """Get the current availability of a stock."""
    return f"The current stock available of {stock_symbol} is {random.randint(100, 1000)}."


team.set_tools([get_stock_price, get_stock_availability])

team.print_response("What is the current stock price of NVDA?", stream=True)
team.print_response("How much stock NVDA stock is available?", stream=True)

```

<Tip>

- The `add_tool` method allows you to dynamically extend an Agent's or a Team's capabilities. This is particularly useful when you want to add tools based on user input or other runtime conditions.
- The `set_tool` method allows you to override an Agent's or a Team's capabilities. Note that this will remove any existing tools previously assigned to your Agent or Team.
