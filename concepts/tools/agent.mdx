**Agents use tools to autonomously take actions and interact with external systems**.

When you give an agent a set of tools, the LLM decides which tools to call, when to call them, and what arguments to use based on the task at hand. This is what makes agents "agentic" - they have autonomy in tool usage.

<Tip>
**Agent tools vs Team tools:** Use agent-level tools for single-agent applications where each agent has its own capabilities. For multi-agent systems where agents need to share tools, see [Tools with Teams](/concepts/tools/team).
</Tip>

For example, if you ask an agent "What's the stock price of AAPL and latest news?", an agent with financial and search tools will automatically:
1. Call the stock price tool for AAPL
2. Call the search tool for Apple news
3. Synthesize the results into a coherent response

You can use any Python function as a tool or use a pre-built Agno **toolkit**.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(
    # Add functions or Toolkits
    tools=[...],
)
```

## Using a Toolkit

Agno provides many pre-built **toolkits** that you can add to your Agents. For example, let's use the DuckDuckGo toolkit to search the web.

<Tip>
  You can find more toolkits in the [Toolkits](/concepts/tools/toolkits) guide.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new file">
    Create a file `web_search.py`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add code to file">
    ```python web_search.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

    agent = Agent(tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], markdown=True)
    agent.print_response("Whats happening in France?", stream=True)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Snippet file="create-venv-step.mdx" />

  <Step title="Install libraries">
    ```shell
    pip install openai ddgs agno
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set OpenAI Key">
    <Snippet file="set-openai-key.mdx" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the agent">
    ```shell
    python web_search.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing your own Tools

For more control, write your own python functions and add them as tools to an Agent. For example, here's how to create a product inventory lookup tool:

```python inventory_agent.py
import json
from agno.agent import Agent

def check_inventory(product_id: str) -> str:
    """Check the current inventory for a product.

    Args:
        product_id (str): The product ID to check inventory for.

    Returns:
        str: JSON string with inventory information.
    """
    # Simulate database lookup
    inventory = {
        "P001": {"name": "Laptop", "stock": 45, "price": 999.99, "warehouse": "West"},
        "P002": {"name": "Mouse", "stock": 230, "price": 29.99, "warehouse": "East"},
        "P003": {"name": "Keyboard", "stock": 0, "price": 79.99, "warehouse": "West"},
    }

    product = inventory.get(product_id, {"error": "Product not found"})
    return json.dumps(product)

agent = Agent(tools=[check_inventory], markdown=True)
agent.print_response("Check if product P001 is in stock and tell me the price", stream=True)
```
