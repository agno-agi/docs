You can specify which tools to include or exclude from a `Toolkit` by using the `include_tools` and `exclude_tools` parameters. This can be very useful to limit the number of tools that are available to an Agent.

## When to Use Tool Selection

Use `include_tools` or `exclude_tools` when you need to:

- **Reduce token usage** - Fewer tools mean smaller prompts and lower costs
- **Improve accuracy** - Limiting choices helps the agent pick the right tool
- **Enforce security** - Exclude tools that could be dangerous for certain use cases
- **Simplify behavior** - Give the agent only what it needs for a specific task
- **Test specific tools** - Include only the tools you're testing

**Example scenarios:**
- Email agent that can only read, not send (`exclude_tools=["send_email", "create_draft"]`)
- Research agent with search but no calculator (`include_tools=["search"]`)
- Production environment excluding experimental tools

## Usage

For example, here's how to include only the `get_latest_emails` tool in the `GmailTools` toolkit:

```python
agent = Agent(
    tools=[GmailTools(include_tools=["get_latest_emails"])],
)
```

Similarly, here's how to exclude the `create_draft_email` tool from the `GmailTools` toolkit:

```python
agent = Agent(
    tools=[GmailTools(exclude_tools=["create_draft_email"])],
)
```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `include_tools` and `exclude_tools` parameters to limit the number of tools that are available to an Agent:

```python include_exclude_tools.py

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.calculator import CalculatorTools
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[
        CalculatorTools(
            exclude_tools=["exponentiate", "factorial", "is_prime", "square_root"],
        ),
        DuckDuckGoTools(include_tools=["duckduckgo_search"]),
    ],
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response(
    "Search the web for a difficult sum that can be done with normal arithmetic and solve it.",
)
```
