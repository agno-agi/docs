Creating custom tools is essential for building production-ready agents. Agno makes it simple to turn any Python function into a tool that agents can use.

## Why Create Custom Tools?

While Agno provides 120+ pre-built toolkits, most production applications need custom tools to:
- **Integrate with internal systems** - Connect to your databases, APIs, and services
- **Implement domain-specific logic** - Encode your business rules and workflows
- **Control agent capabilities** - Define exactly what actions agents can perform

## Quick Decision Guide

| Criteria | Python Functions | Toolkits |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Number of tools** | 1-3 simple tools | 4+ related tools |
| **Shared state** | No shared state | Share configuration or connections |
| **Setup complexity** | Minimal - just a function | Requires class structure |
| **Reusability** | Less reusable | Highly reusable across agents |
| **Best for** | Quick custom logic | Related tools (e.g., database operations) |
