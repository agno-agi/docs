When we as humans learn something that can be useful in the future, we tend to communicate it. The consolidation of this shared knowledge, is the foundation of what we call culture.

With Agno, you can now equip your Agents with similar collective knowledge, that persists beyond individual memory, using our Culture feature.

## How Culture Works

Culture provides agents with knowledge, principles, and insights that transcend individual conversations and remain useful across them.

Unlike Memory, which stores user-specific information ("Sarah prefers email"), Culture stores universal knowledge that benefits all interactions ("Always provide actionable solutions with clear next steps").

Using Culture, your Agents will be able to transmit relevant learnings to each other and across time - similarly to how we transmit knowledge across generations.


## Getting Started with Culture

To start using Culture, you just need to equip your Agent with a database and enable the Culture feature:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

# Setup your database
db = SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db")

# Setup your Agent with Culture
agent = Agent(
    db=db,
    enable_culture=True,  # This enables Culture for the Agent
)
```
