title: Multimodal Teams
---

Agno teams support text, image, audio, video and files inputs and can generate text, image, audio, video and files as output across all team members.

For a complete overview of multimodal support, please checkout the [multimodal](/concepts/multimodal/overview) documentation.

<Tip>
Not all models support multimodal inputs and outputs.
To see which models support multimodal inputs and outputs, please checkout the [compatibility matrix](/concepts/models/compatibility).

## Multimodal inputs to a team

Teams can process multimodal inputs and distribute them to appropriate team members based on their specializations.

### Image Processing Team

```python image_team.py
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.media import Image
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Specialized team members
image_analyst = Agent(
    name="Image Analyst",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=[
        "You are an expert image analyst.",
        "Analyze images in detail and describe what you see.",
        "Focus on visual elements, composition, and details."
    ],
)

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=[
        "You are a research specialist.",
        "Search for additional information based on image analysis.",
        "Provide context and background information."
    ]
)

# Create multimodal team
image_team = Team(
    members=[image_analyst, researcher],
    instructions="Collaborate to analyze images and provide comprehensive insights."
)

# Process image input
response = image_team.run(
    "Analyze this image and provide historical context",
    images=[Image.from_path("path/to/image.jpg")]
)
print(response.content)
```

### Audio Processing Team

```python audio_team.py
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.media import Audio
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Specialized team for audio processing
transcriber = Agent(
    name="Transcriber",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-audio-preview"),
    instructions=[
        "You are an expert audio transcriber.",
        "Convert audio to text accurately.",
        "Note any audio quality issues or background noise."
    ]
)

content_analyzer = Agent(
    name="Content Analyzer", 
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=[
        "You are a content analysis expert.",
        "Analyze transcribed text for key themes and insights.",
        "Provide summaries and recommendations."
    ]
)

audio_team = Team(
    members=[transcriber, content_analyzer],
    instructions="Work together to transcribe and analyze audio content."
)

# Process audio input
response = audio_team.run(
    "Transcribe this audio and analyze the main topics",
    audio=[Audio.from_path("path/to/audio.mp3")]
)
print(response.content)
```

## Multimodal outputs from teams

Teams can generate various types of media outputs through specialized team members.

### Content Creation Team

```python content_team.py
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.dalle import DallE

writer = Agent(
    name="Content Writer",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=[
        "You are a creative content writer.",
        "Generate engaging text content.",
        "Create compelling narratives and descriptions."
    ]
)

visual_designer = Agent(
    name="Visual Designer",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DallE()],
    instructions=[
        "You are a visual designer.",
        "Create images based on content requirements.",
        "Generate visually appealing and relevant images."
    ]
)

content_team = Team(
    members=[writer, visual_designer],
    instructions="Collaborate to create comprehensive content with text and visuals."
)

response = content_team.run("Create a blog post about AI with accompanying images")
print(response.content)
```

## Team Multimodal Coordination

Teams automatically handle multimodal coordination:

- **Input Distribution**: Route different media types to appropriate team members
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between media formats as needed
- **Output Integration**: Combine multimodal outputs from different team members
- **Quality Control**: Validate multimodal outputs across the team

### Mixed Media Team Example

```python mixed_media_team.py
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.media import Image, Audio, Video
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Versatile team handling multiple media types
media_team = Team(
    members=[
        Agent(
            name="Media Processor",
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
            instructions=["Process any media type and extract key information."]
        ),
        Agent(
            name="Content Synthesizer",
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"), 
            instructions=["Combine insights from different media sources."]
        )
    ],
    instructions="Analyze multiple media types and provide unified insights."
)

# Process multiple media types
response = media_team.run(
    "Analyze these materials and create a comprehensive report",
    images=[Image.from_path("chart.png")],
    audio=[Audio.from_path("interview.mp3")],
    videos=[Video.from_path("presentation.mp4")]
)
print(response.content)
```
