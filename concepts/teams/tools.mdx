description: Learn how to use tools in Agno Teams.
---

**Teams use tools to take actions and interact with external systems**.

Tools are functions that Team members can run to achieve tasks. For example: searching the web, running SQL, sending an email or calling APIs. You can use any python function as a tool or use a pre-built Agno **toolkit**.

Teams can share tools across all members or assign specific tools to individual team members.

The general syntax is:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

# Tools shared across all team members
team = Team(
    members=[...],
    # Add functions or Toolkits available to all members
    tools=[...],
)

# Or assign tools to specific team members
team = Team(
    members=[
        Agent(
            name="Web Researcher",
            tools=[DuckDuckGo()],  # This agent gets web search tools
        ),
        Agent(
            name="Data Analyst", 
            tools=[CSVTools(), SQLTools()],  # This agent gets data tools
        )
    ]
)
```

## Tool Distribution Strategies

### Shared Tools
All team members have access to the same set of tools:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo

team = Team(
    members=[
        Agent(name="Researcher"),
        Agent(name="Analyst"),
    ],
    tools=[DuckDuckGo()],  # Available to all members
)
```

### Specialized Tools
Different team members get different tools based on their roles:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo
from agno.tools.csv import CSVTools

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    tools=[DuckDuckGo()],  # Only researcher can search web
)

analyst = Agent(
    name="Analyst", 
    tools=[CSVTools()],    # Only analyst can work with CSV
)

team = Team(members=[researcher, analyst])
```

### Hybrid Approach
Combine shared and specialized tools:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.email import EmailTools
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo
from agno.tools.csv import CSVTools

team = Team(
    members=[
        Agent(
            name="Researcher",
            tools=[DuckDuckGo()],  # Specialized tool
        ),
        Agent(
            name="Analyst",
            tools=[CSVTools()],    # Specialized tool
        )
    ],
    tools=[EmailTools()],          # Shared tool
)
```

## Tool Coordination

When multiple team members have access to the same tools, Agno automatically handles:

- **Tool call coordination**: Prevents conflicts when multiple agents try to use the same tool
- **Result sharing**: Tool results can be shared across team members
- **Resource management**: Efficiently manages tool resources across the team
