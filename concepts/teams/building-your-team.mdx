When building a Team, it is important to consider the following:
- **Which models to use?** -> See the [Models](/concepts/models/introduction) documentation.
- **Which tools to use?** -> See the [Tools](/concepts/teams/tools) documentation.
- **Which instructions to use?** -> See the [Context Engineering](/concepts/teams/context) documentation.
- **Should I enable reasoning?** -> See the [Reasoning](/concepts/reasoning/introduction) documentation.
- **Do I need to add knowledge?** -> See the [Knowledge](/concepts/teams/knowledge) documentation.
- **How do I configure storage?** -> See the [Storage](/concepts/teams/storage) documentation.
- **How do I configure memory?** -> See the [Memory](/concepts/teams/memory) documentation.
- **How do I handle delegation?** -> See the [Delegation](/concepts/teams/delegation) documentation.

## The Development Process

It is typical while developing a Team to use the `Team.print_response()` method to print the response in the terminal. This is only for convenience during development and not recommended for production use.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Create team members
data_analyst = Agent(
    name="Data Analyst",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=["You are a data analyst expert in data analysis and visualization."]
)

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher", 
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=["You are a researcher expert in finding and analyzing information."]
)

# Create team
team = Team(
    members=[data_analyst, researcher],
    instructions="Collaborate to analyze data and provide insights."
)

team.print_response("Analyze the sales trends for Q4 and provide recommendations")

# Or for streaming
team.print_response("Analyze the sales trends for Q4 and provide recommendations", stream=True)
```

## Development Tips

- Start with simple team configurations and add complexity gradually
- Test individual team members before combining them
- Use clear, specific instructions for each team member's role
- Consider the delegation patterns for your use case
- Monitor team interactions during development
