Agno and AgentOS make it easy to deploy your agents on WhatsApp with just 2 extra lines of code.

This example creates a simple agent for answering questions and generating images:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.openai import OpenAITools
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.os.interfaces.whatsapp import Whatsapp

image_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5.2"), # Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set
    tools=[OpenAITools(image_model="gpt-image-1")],
    markdown=True,
    add_history_to_context=True,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[image_agent],
    interfaces=[Whatsapp(agent=image_agent)],
)
app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="whatsapp_bot:app", port=7777, reload=True)
```

<Note>
The user's phone number is automatically used as the `user_id` for runs. This ensures that sessions and memory are appropriately scoped to the user. The phone number is also used for the `session_id`, so a single WhatsApp conversation corresponds to a single session.

## Setup and Configuration

<Steps>

<Step title="Prerequisites">
Ensure you have the following:
- A Meta Developer Account
- A Meta Business Account
- A valid Facebook account
- ngrok (for development)
- Python 3.7+
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Meta App">
1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and verify your account.
2. Create a new app at [Meta Apps Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
3. Under "Use Case", select "Other".
4. Choose "Business" as the app type.
5. Provide:
    - App name
    - Contact email
6. Click "Create App".
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up a Meta Business Account">
1. Navigate to [Meta Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/).
2. Create a new business account or use an existing one.
3. Verify your business by clicking on the email link.
4. Go to your App page, navigate to "App settings / Basic", and click "Start Verification" under "Business Verification". Complete the verification process for production.
5. Associate the app with your business account and click "Create App".
</Step>

<Step title="Setup WhatsApp Business API">
1. Go to your app's WhatsApp Setup page.
2. Click on "Start using the API" (API Setup).
3. Generate an Access Token.
4. Copy your Phone Number ID.
5. Copy your WhatsApp Business Account ID.
6. Add a "To" number that you will use for testing (this will likely be your personal number).
</Step>

<Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content, replacing placeholder values with your actual credentials:
```bash
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_whatsapp_access_token"
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID="your_phone_number_id"
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN="your_chosen_verify_token"  # A string you create
```
</Step>

<Step title="Setup Webhook with ngrok">
1. Run ngrok to expose your local server, ensuring the port matches your app (7777):
   ```bash
   ngrok http 7777
   # Or, if you have a paid ngrok plan with a static domain:
   # ngrok http --domain=your-custom-domain.ngrok-free.app 7777
   ```
2. Copy the `https://` URL provided by ngrok. This is your base ngrok URL.
3. Construct your full webhook URL by appending `/whatsapp/webhook` to the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://<random-string>.ngrok-free.app/whatsapp/webhook`).
4. In your Meta App's WhatsApp Setup page, navigate to the "Webhook" section and click "Edit".
5. Configure the webhook:
    - **Callback URL**: Enter your full ngrok webhook URL.
    - **Verify Token**: Enter the same value you used for `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` in your `.env` file.
6. Click "Verify and save". Your Agno application must be running locally for verification to succeed.
7. After successful verification, click "Manage" next to Webhook fields. Subscribe to the `messages` field under `whatsapp_business_account`.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Application Environment">
Set the `APP_ENV` environment variable:
- For **Development Mode**:
  ```bash
  APP_ENV="development"
  ```
  (Webhook signature validation might be less strict or bypassed).
- For **Production Mode**:
  ```bash
  APP_ENV="production"
  ```
  You will also need to set the `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` for webhook signature validation:
  ```bash
  WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET="your_meta_app_secret"
  ```
  This should be the "App Secret" found in your Meta App's "App settings > Basic" page.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
ngrok is used only for local development and testing. For production deployments, see the [deployment tutorials](/production/templates/overview).
