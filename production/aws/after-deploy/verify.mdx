After running `ag infra up prd:aws`, verify everything is working before proceeding.

## Check the Health Endpoint

Get your load balancer DNS from the AWS Console (EC2 → Load Balancers), then:

```bash
curl http://[LOAD_BALANCER_DNS]/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status": "ok", "instantiated_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"}
```

## Check CloudWatch Logs

```bash
aws logs tail /ecs/{infra_name}-prd --follow
```

Look for these lines indicating successful startup:

```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

<Note>
Replace `{infra_name}` with your `infra_name` from `settings.py` (e.g., `agentos-aws-template`).
</Note>

## Check ECS Service Status

```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster {infra_name}-prd \
  --services {infra_name}-prd-service \
  --query 'services[0].{status:status,running:runningCount,desired:desiredCount}'
```

Expected output:
```json
{
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "running": 1,
    "desired": 1
}
```

## What Success Looks Like

| Check | Expected |
|-------|----------|
| Health endpoint | Returns `{"status": "ok", ...}` |
| CloudWatch logs | Shows "Application startup complete" |
| ECS service | Running count matches desired count |
| Load balancer targets | Shows "healthy" in AWS Console |

## If Something Is Wrong

| Symptom | Next Step |
|---------|-----------|
| Health returns error | Check [CloudWatch logs](/production/aws/manage/monitoring) |
| No logs appearing | Check ECS task started in AWS Console |
| Task keeps restarting | See [Troubleshooting](/production/aws/manage/troubleshooting) |
