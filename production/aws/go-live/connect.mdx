<Step title="Enter your endpoint">
Enter your production URL:
```

```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
The instance should show "Connected" status.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verify Connection

Once connected, you should see:
- Your agents listed in the dashboard
- Real-time status updates
- Ability to interact with your agents

## Troubleshooting

| Status | Cause | Solution |
|--------|-------|----------|
| "Unhealthy" | Health check failing | Check `/health` endpoint returns 200 |
| "Unreachable" | Network issue | Verify HTTPS certificate is valid |
| "Connection refused" | Firewall blocking | Check security group allows inbound 443 |

### Check from os.agno.com's perspective

Your endpoint must be publicly accessible. Test from outside your network:

```bash
curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com/health
```

Should return `HTTP/2 200`.
