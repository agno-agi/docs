1. `cd` into the `agent-infra-railway` directory

```bash
cd agent-infra-railway
```

2. Install the Railway CLI (More details [here](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli)):

```sh
brew install railway
```

3. Login to your Railway account:

```sh
railway login
```

Note: Remember to either export the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

4. Run the deployment script:

```sh
./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

5. Monitor the deployment (Optional):

```sh
railway logs --service agent_os
```

6. Access the application via the Railway UI:

```sh
railway open

7. In the CLI, you will see the domain of your application. Click on it to access your AgentOS FastAPI server. You can navigate to `<railway-domain>/docs` to access the API documentation.

8. On Agno AgentOS UI, connect your OS with the domain you just created.

- Open the [Agno AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).
- Connect your OS with `<railway-domain>` as the endpoint.

### Updating your Railway Deployment

This will trigger a new deployment of your application by creating a new docker image and deploying it to Railway.

railway down --service pgvector
```
