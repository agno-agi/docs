External tool execution gives you complete control over when and how certain tools actually run. Instead of letting the agent execute the tool directly, it pauses and waits for you to handle the execution yourself. This is incredibly useful when you need:

- **Enhanced security**: Execute sensitive operations in a controlled environment
- **External service calls**: Integrate with services that require special handling
- **Database operations**: Run queries through your own connection management
- **Custom execution logic**: Add validation, logging, or rate limiting before execution
- **Sandboxed environments**: Execute potentially dangerous operations safely

## How It Works

When you mark a tool with `external_execution=True`, your agent will:

1. **Pause execution** when the tool is about to be called
2. **Set `is_paused` to `True`** on the run response
3. **Populate `tools_awaiting_external_execution`** with tools that need external handling
4. **Wait for you** to execute the tool and set its result
5. **Continue execution** once you call `continue_run()` with the result

The key difference from other HITL patterns is that the agent never actually calls the function—you're responsible for the entire execution.

```python
import subprocess

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools import tool
from agno.utils import pprint


# Create a tool with the correct name, arguments and docstring for the agent to know what to call.
@tool(external_execution=True)
def execute_shell_command(command: str) -> str:
    """Execute a shell command.

    Args:
        command (str): The shell command to execute

    Returns:
        str: The output of the shell command
    """
    return subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True).decode("utf-8")


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[execute_shell_command],
    markdown=True,
)

run_response = agent.run("What files do I have in my current directory?")
if run_response.is_paused:
    for tool in run_response.tools_awaiting_external_execution:
        if tool.tool_name == execute_shell_command.name:
            print(f"Executing {tool.tool_name} with args {tool.tool_args} externally")

            # Execute the tool manually. You can execute any function or process here and use the tool_args as input.
            result = execute_shell_command.entrypoint(**tool.tool_args)
            # Set the result on the tool execution object so that the agent can continue
            tool.result = result

    run_response = agent.continue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, updated_tools=run_response.tools)
    pprint.pprint_run_response(run_response)
```

In this example, the agent identifies that it needs to run `execute_shell_command` but doesn't actually execute it. Instead, it pauses and gives you the tool name and arguments. You then execute it yourself (or something completely different!) and provide the result back.

## Understanding `tools_awaiting_external_execution`

When a run is paused for external execution, the `tools_awaiting_external_execution` property contains all tools that need to be executed externally. Each tool has:

- **`tool_name`**: The name of the tool that was called
- **`tool_args`**: A dictionary of arguments the agent wants to pass to the tool
- **`external_execution_required`**: A boolean flag set to `True`
- **`result`**: Where you set the execution result (initially `None`)

You can iterate through these tools, execute them however you want, and set their results:

```python
if run_response.is_paused:
    for tool in run_response.tools_awaiting_external_execution:
        print(f"Tool: {tool.tool_name}")
        print(f"Args: {tool.tool_args}")
        
        # Execute your custom logic here
        result = my_custom_execution(tool.tool_args)
        
        # Set the result so the agent can continue
        tool.result = result
    
    # Continue the run with the updated tools
    response = agent.continue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, updated_tools=run_response.tools)
```

<Note>
**Important**: You *must* set `tool.result` for all tools in `tools_awaiting_external_execution` before calling `continue_run()`. If you try to continue without setting results, Agno will raise a `ValueError`.
</Note>

## Using Toolkits with External Execution

If you're using a `Toolkit`, you can specify which tools require external execution using the `external_execution_required_tools` parameter:

```python
from agno.tools.toolkit import Toolkit
import subprocess

class ShellTools(Toolkit):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(
            tools=[self.list_dir, self.get_env],
            external_execution_required_tools=["list_dir"],  # Only this one needs external execution
            *args,
            **kwargs,
        )

    def list_dir(self, directory: str):
        """Lists the contents of a directory."""
        return subprocess.check_output(f"ls {directory}", shell=True).decode("utf-8")
    
    def get_env(self, var_name: str):
        """Gets an environment variable."""
        import os
        return os.getenv(var_name, "Not found")

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[ShellTools()],
    markdown=True,
)

run_response = agent.run("What files are in my current directory and what's my PATH?")
if run_response.is_paused:
    # Only list_dir will be here, get_env runs normally
    for tool in run_response.tools_awaiting_external_execution:
        if tool.tool_name == "list_dir":
            result = ShellTools().list_dir(**tool.tool_args)
            tool.result = result
    
    run_response = agent.continue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, updated_tools=run_response.tools)
```

This lets you mix external and internal tools in the same toolkit—perfect when you only need special handling for specific operations.

## Mixed Tool Scenarios

You can absolutely have a mix of regular tools and external execution tools in the same agent. When the agent wants to call multiple tools, only the ones marked with `external_execution=True` will cause a pause:

```python
@tool(external_execution=True)
def sensitive_database_query(query: str) -> str:
    """Execute a database query."""
    pass

@tool
def safe_calculation(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Perform a safe calculation."""
    return x + y

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[sensitive_database_query, safe_calculation],
    markdown=True,
)

response = agent.run("Calculate 5 + 10 and query the users table")

# Agent will pause when it tries to call sensitive_database_query
# but safe_calculation executes normally
if response.is_paused:
    for tool in response.tools_awaiting_external_execution:
        if tool.tool_name == "sensitive_database_query":
            # Execute with your own DB connection and security checks
            result = execute_safe_db_query(tool.tool_args["query"])
            tool.result = result
    
    response = agent.continue_run(run_id=response.run_id, updated_tools=response.tools)
```

## Async Support

External execution works seamlessly with async operations. Use `arun()` and `acontinue_run()` for async flows:

```python
import asyncio

@tool(external_execution=True)
async def async_external_tool(data: str) -> str:
    """An async tool requiring external execution."""
    pass

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[async_external_tool],
    markdown=True,
)

async def main():
    run_response = await agent.arun("Process some data")
    
    if run_response.is_paused:
        for tool in run_response.tools_awaiting_external_execution:
            # Execute your async external logic
            result = await my_async_external_service(tool.tool_args)
            tool.result = result
        
        response = await agent.acontinue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, updated_tools=run_response.tools)
        print(response.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Streaming Support

You can also use external execution with streaming responses:

```python
for run_event in agent.run("What files are in my directory?", stream=True):
    if run_event.is_paused:
        for tool in run_event.tools_awaiting_external_execution:
            # Execute externally
            result = execute_tool_externally(tool)
            tool.result = result
        
        # Continue streaming
        for response in agent.continue_run(
            run_id=run_event.run_id, 
            updated_tools=run_event.tools, 
            stream=True
        ):
            print(response.content, end="")
    else:
        print(run_event.content, end="")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always set results**: Make sure you set `tool.result` for all tools in `tools_awaiting_external_execution` before continuing
2. **Error handling**: Wrap your external execution in try-catch blocks and provide meaningful error messages as results
3. **Security validation**: Use external execution to add extra security checks before running sensitive operations
4. **Logging**: Log all external executions for audit trails
5. **Timeouts**: Consider adding timeouts to your external execution logic to prevent hanging

<Warning>
Remember that external execution tools marked with `external_execution=True` are mutually exclusive with `requires_confirmation=True` and `requires_user_input=True`. A tool can only use one of these patterns at a time.
</Warning>
