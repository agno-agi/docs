Agno Tracing provides OpenTelemetry-based observability for Agno agents, teams, and workflows. It automatically captures execution details, helping you understand what your agents are doing, debug issues, and optimize performance.

## Why Tracing?

As agents become more complex—using multiple tools, making sequential decisions, and coordinating with other agents—understanding their behavior becomes challenging. Tracing solves this by:

- **Debugging**: See exactly what went wrong when an agent fails
- **Performance**: Identify bottlenecks in agent execution
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor token usage and API calls
- **Behavior Analysis**: Understand decision-making patterns
- **Audit Trail**: Track what agents did and why

<Note>
It is all stored in your own database, so nothing leaves the system and no data is sent to third parties.
</Note>

## Understanding Traces and Spans

Think of tracing like a family tree for your agent's execution:

### Trace
A **trace** represents one complete agent execution from start to finish. Each trace has a unique `trace_id` that groups all related operations together.

### Span
A **span** is a single operation within that execution. Spans form a parent-child hierarchy:

/>

<img 
  className="hidden dark:block" 
  src="/images/traces-vs-spans-dark.png" 
  alt="Traces vs spans diagram"
/>

Each span captures:
- **What happened**: Operation name (e.g., `agent.run`, `model.response`)
- **When**: Start and end timestamps
- **Context**: Input arguments, outputs, token usage
- **Relationships**: Parent span, child spans
- **Metadata**: Agent ID, session ID, run ID

## What Gets Traced

Agno automatically captures:

  <Card title="Agent Runs" icon="robot">
    Every `agent.run()` or `agent.arun()` call with full context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Calls" icon="brain">
    LLM interactions including prompts, responses, and token usage

## Key Features

- **Zero-Code Instrumentation**: No need to modify your agent code
- **Database Storage**: Traces stored in your Agno database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Flexible Querying**: Filter by agent, session, run, or time range
- **OpenTelemetry Standard**: Export to external tools like Arize Phoenix, Langfuse
- **Non-Blocking**: Tracing never slows down your agents
- **Configurable**: Adjust batch sizes and processing for your needs

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    pip install -U opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk openinference-instrumentation-agno
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Tracing">
    ```python
    from agno.tracing import setup_tracing
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/traces.db")
    setup_tracing(db=db) # Call this once at startup
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your Agent">
    ```python
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

    agent = Agent(
        name="My Agent",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
    )
    
    agent.run("Hello!")  # Automatically traced!
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Query Traces">
    ```python
    traces, total = db.get_traces(agent_id=agent.id, limit=10)
    for trace in traces:
        print(f"{trace.name}: {trace.duration_ms}ms")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
