When you call `Agent.run()`, it creates a single, stateless interaction. The agent responds to your message and that's it - no memory of what just happened.

But most real applications need **conversations**, not just one-off exchanges. That's where sessions come in.

## What's a Session?

Think of a session as a conversation thread. It's a collection of back-and-forth interactions (called "runs") between a user and your Agent, Team, or Workflow. Each session gets a unique `session_id` that ties together all the runs, chat history, state, and metrics for that conversation.

Here's the breakdown:

- **Session**: A multi-turn conversation identified by a `session_id`. Contains all the runs, history, state, and metrics for that conversation thread.
- **Run**: A single interaction within a session. Every time you call `Agent.run()`, `Team.run()`, or `Workflow.run()`, a new `run_id` is created. Think of it as one message-and-response pair in the conversation.

<Note>
Sessions require a database to store history and state. See [Session Storage](/basics/storage/overview) for setup details.
</Note>


## Single-Run Example

When you run an agent without specifying a `session_id`, Agno automatically generates both a `run_id` and a `session_id` for you:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run the agent - Agno auto-generates session_id and run_id
response = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
print(response.content)
print(f"Run ID: {response.run_id}")        # Auto-generated UUID
print(f"Session ID: {response.session_id}") # Auto-generated UUID
```

This creates a new session with a single run. But here's the catch: without a database configured, there's no persistence. The `session_id` exists for this single run, but you can't continue the conversation later because nothing is saved. To actually use sessions for multi-turn conversations, you need to configure a database (even an `InMemoryDb` works).

## Multi-User Conversations

In production, you'll typically have multiple users talking to the same agent simultaneously. Each user should have their own isolated conversation threads.

Here's how Agno handles this:

- Use `user_id` to identify different users
- Use `session_id` to identify different conversation threads for each user
- One user can have multiple sessions (like having multiple chat windows open)
- Configure a database to persist these conversations
- Set `add_history_to_context=True` so the agent remembers what was said earlier

Let's see this in action with two users having separate conversations:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

# Set up a database to persist sessions
db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    db=db,
    add_history_to_context=True,  # Remember conversation history
    num_history_runs=3,             # Include last 3 messages as context
)

# Define user and session identifiers
user_1_id = "user_101"
user_2_id = "user_102"

user_1_session_id = "session_101"
user_2_session_id = "session_102"

# User 1 starts a conversation
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot.",
    user_id=user_1_id,
    session_id=user_1_session_id,
)

# User 1 continues their conversation
agent.print_response(
    "Now tell me a joke.", 
    user_id=user_1_id, 
    session_id=user_1_session_id
)

# Meanwhile, User 2 starts a completely different conversation
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me about quantum physics.", 
    user_id=user_2_id, 
    session_id=user_2_session_id
)

# User 2 continues their own conversation
agent.print_response(
    "What is the speed of light?", 
    user_id=user_2_id, 
    session_id=user_2_session_id
)

# User 1 can reference their conversation history (not User 2's!)
agent.print_response(
    "Give me a summary of our conversation.",
    user_id=user_1_id,
    session_id=user_1_session_id,
)
# The agent will summarize the robot story and joke - it won't mention quantum physics
```

Notice how each user's conversation is completely isolated. User 1's summary only includes their robot story and joke, not User 2's quantum physics discussion. This is the power of sessions - they keep conversations organized and private.

<Check>
The `add_history_to_context=True` and `num_history_runs=3` parameters are what give the agent "memory". Without these, each message would be treated as a brand new conversation.

## Session Summaries

As conversations grow longer, passing the entire chat history to your LLM becomes expensive and slow. Session summaries solve this by automatically condensing your conversation into a concise summary that captures the key points.

Think of it like taking notes during a long meeting - you don't need a transcript of everything said, just the important bits.

To enable session summaries, simply set `enable_session_summaries=True`:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    db=db,
    enable_session_summaries=True,  # Auto-generate summaries
)
```

Agno will automatically create and update summaries as the conversation progresses. You can then use these summaries instead of the full chat history to save tokens and improve response times.

## Session Storage Schema

When you configure a database, Agno stores sessions in a structured format. Here's what gets saved for each session:

| Field           | Type   | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `session_id`    | `str`  | Unique identifier for this conversation thread   |
| `session_type`  | `str`  | Type of session (agent, team, or workflow)       |
| `agent_id`      | `str`  | The agent ID (if this is an agent session)       |
| `team_id`       | `str`  | The team ID (if this is a team session)          |
| `workflow_id`   | `str`  | The workflow ID (if this is a workflow session)  |
| `user_id`       | `str`  | The user this session belongs to                 |
| `session_data`  | `dict` | Session-specific data and state                  |
| `agent_data`    | `dict` | Agent configuration and metadata                 |
| `team_data`     | `dict` | Team configuration and metadata                  |
| `workflow_data` | `dict` | Workflow configuration and metadata              |
| `metadata`      | `dict` | Additional custom metadata                       |
| `runs`          | `list` | All the runs (interactions) in this session      |
| `summary`       | `dict` | The session summary (if enabled)                 |
| `created_at`    | `int`  | Unix timestamp when session was created          |
| `updated_at`    | `int`  | Unix timestamp of last update                    |
