## Research Workflow with Q&A

```python
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.workflow.agent import WorkflowAgent
from agno.workflow.step import Step
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="Research topics thoroughly and provide detailed reports",
)

workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    num_history_runs=10,
    instructions="""
    You manage a research workflow.
    
    - Run NEW research when the user asks about topics not in history
    - Answer questions about PREVIOUS research from the workflow history
    - Be smart: only run the workflow when you need new information
    """,
)

research_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Research Assistant",
    description="Researches topics and answers questions about findings",
    agent=workflow_agent,
    steps=[Step(name="Research", agent=researcher)],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="research.db"),
)

# Usage
research_workflow.run(input="Research artificial intelligence")
# → Executes workflow

research_workflow.run(input="What did you find about AI?")
# → Answers from history (no execution)

research_workflow.run(input="Now research machine learning")
# → Executes workflow (new topic)

research_workflow.run(input="Compare AI and ML findings")
# → Answers from history
```

## Content Generation with Memory

```python
content_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Generator",
    description="Generates blog posts and social media content",
    agent=WorkflowAgent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        num_history_runs=20,
        instructions="""
        You manage a content generation workflow.
        
        - Generate NEW content when requested
        - Answer questions about PREVIOUS content from history
        - Help analyze and improve past content without regenerating
        """,
    ),
    steps=[Step(name="Generate Content", agent=content_creator)],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="content.db"),
)

# Generate new content
content_workflow.run(input="Write a blog post about Python best practices")
# → Executes workflow

# Ask about it
content_workflow.run(input="What topics did that blog post cover?")
# → Answers from history

# Analyze without regenerating
content_workflow.run(input="What's our total word count across all posts?")
# → Answers from history
```

## Data Analysis Pipeline

```python
analysis_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Data Analysis Pipeline",
    description="Analyzes data and generates insights",
    agent=WorkflowAgent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        num_history_runs=15,
    ),
    steps=[
        Step(name="Load Data", agent=data_loader),
        Step(name="Analyze", agent=analyst),
        Step(name="Visualize", agent=visualizer),
    ],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="analysis.db"),
)

# Run analysis
analysis_workflow.run(input="Analyze Q3 sales data")
# → Executes full 3-step workflow

# Get details without re-running
analysis_workflow.run(input="What were the key insights from Q3?")
# → Answers from history (saves compute!)

# Compare multiple runs
analysis_workflow.run(input="Analyze Q4 sales data")
# → Executes workflow (new data)

analysis_workflow.run(input="Compare Q3 and Q4 performance")
# → Answers from history (both are available)
```

## Customer Support Continuity

```python
support_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Customer Support",
    description="Handles customer support tickets",
    agent=WorkflowAgent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        num_history_runs=20,
        instructions="""
        You manage customer support workflows.
        
        Process NEW tickets by running the workflow.
        Answer questions about PREVIOUS tickets from history.
        """,
    ),
    steps=[Step(name="Process Ticket", agent=support_agent)],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="support.db"),
)

# Process ticket
support_workflow.run(input="Customer reports login issue", session_id="customer-123")
# → Executes workflow

# Follow-up question
support_workflow.run(input="What was the resolution for the login issue?", session_id="customer-123")
# → Answers from history
```

## Best Practices

### Monitor Execution Decisions

```python
result = workflow.run(input="Your query")

if result.workflow_agent_run:
    if result.workflow_agent_run.tools:
        print("Agent executed the workflow")
    else:
        print("Agent answered from history")
```

### Balance History Size

```python
# Quick Q&A: Less history
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    num_history_runs=3,
)

# Analysis: More history
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    num_history_runs=20,
)
```
