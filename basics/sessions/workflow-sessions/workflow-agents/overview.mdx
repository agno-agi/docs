## What are Workflow Agents?

A Workflow Agent is a special type of agent that acts as a smart orchestrator for your workflow. Instead of always executing all workflow steps, the WorkflowAgent decides whether to run the workflow or answer directly from previous workflow history.

Think of it as adding an intelligent decision layer on top of your workflow that can:
- Answer questions about previous workflow runs without re-executing
- Compare or analyze results from past executions
- Only trigger new workflow runs when genuinely needed

## Why Use Workflow Agents?

Workflow Agents are useful when you want to:

- **Save computation costs** by avoiding unnecessary workflow executions
- **Answer follow-up questions** about previous runs without re-running
- **Enable analysis** of past workflow results (comparisons, summaries, trends)
- **Provide conversational interfaces** to workflow outputs
- **Make workflows smarter** about when they actually need to execute

## How Workflow Agents Work

When you add a WorkflowAgent to your workflow:

1. User sends input to the workflow
2. WorkflowAgent receives the input + workflow history
3. Agent decides: "Can I answer from history, or do I need to run the workflow?"
4. **Option A:** Answers directly from history (fast, no execution)
5. **Option B:** Calls `run_workflow` tool to execute (full workflow run)

## Quick Example

```python
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.workflow.agent import WorkflowAgent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

# Create a workflow agent
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    add_workflow_history=True,  # Give agent access to history
    num_history_runs=5,          # Include last 5 runs
)

# Add to workflow
workflow = Workflow(
    name="Research Pipeline",
    description="Researches topics and generates reports",
    agent=workflow_agent,  # ← This makes it intelligent
    steps=[...],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="research.db"),
)

# First run - agent executes workflow
result1 = workflow.run(input="Research AI trends")

# Second run - agent might answer from history without executing
result2 = workflow.run(input="What were the AI trends you just researched?")
```

## When Agent Runs vs Answers

### Agent Runs the Workflow

The agent will execute when:
- The query is about a **new topic** not in history
- The user explicitly requests a **new execution**
- The question **cannot be answered** from existing history

### Agent Answers from History

The agent will answer directly when:
- The question is about **previous runs**
- The user wants to **compare past results**
- The query is a **follow-up** about recent outputs

## Key Differences

| Feature | Regular Agent | Workflow Agent |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Execute tasks directly | Orchestrate workflow execution |
| **Tools** | Can have any tools | Only has `run_workflow` tool |
| **History** | Gets conversation messages | Gets workflow run history |
| **Decision** | Responds to each message | Decides whether to run workflow |

## Best Practices

### Write Clear Workflow Descriptions

```python
# Good: Clear description
workflow = Workflow(
    name="Customer Support",
    description="Analyzes customer tickets and generates support responses",
    agent=workflow_agent,
)
```

### Provide Agent Instructions

```python
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="""
    You manage a research workflow.
    
    Run NEW research when requested.
    Answer questions about PREVIOUS research from history.
    Be efficient: only run the workflow when needed.
    """,
)
```

### Balance History Size

```python
# For quick Q&A workflows
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    num_history_runs=3,  # Just recent context
)

# For analysis workflows
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    num_history_runs=20,  # More history for analysis
)
```
