As conversations grow longer, passing the entire chat history to your LLM becomes expensive and slow. Session summaries solve this by automatically condensing conversations into concise summaries that capture the key points.

Think of it like taking notes during a long meeting - you don't need a transcript of everything said, just the important bits.

<Note>
Session summaries work identically for Agents and Teams. All examples in this section show both implementations.

## The Problem: Growing Token Costs

Without summaries, every message adds to your context window:

```
Run 1: 100 tokens
Run 2: 250 tokens (100 history + 150 new)
Run 3: 450 tokens (250 history + 200 new)
Run 4: 750 tokens (450 history + 300 new)
...exponential growth
```

This quickly becomes expensive and hits context limits.

## The Solution: Automatic Summaries

Session summaries condense your history:

```
Run 1: 100 tokens
Run 2: 250 tokens
[Summary created: 50 tokens]
Run 3: 250 tokens (50 summary + 200 new)
Run 4: 350 tokens (50 summary + 300 new)
...linear growth
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Dramatically reduced token costs
- ✅ Avoid context window limits
- ✅ Maintain conversation continuity
- ✅ Automatic creation and updates

## How It Works

Session summaries follow a simple three-step pattern:

### 1. Enable Summary Generation
Set `enable_session_summaries=True` on your agent or team. Summaries are automatically created and updated after each conversation turn, then stored in your database.

### 2. Use Summaries in Context  
Set `add_session_summary_to_context=True` to include the summary in your messages. Instead of sending dozens of historical messages, only the condensed summary is sent, dramatically reducing tokens while maintaining context.

### 3. Customize (Optional)
Use `SessionSummaryManager` to control summary generation - use a cheaper model, customize prompts, or change the summary format. This lets you optimize costs by using a lightweight model for summaries while keeping your main agent powerful.

## Key Features

### Automatic Creation & Updates
- Summaries are created automatically after conversations
- Updated incrementally as new messages arrive
- No manual intervention needed

### Flexible Usage
- **Create only**: Generate summaries for storage
- **Use only**: Retrieve and use existing summaries
- **Both**: Create and use summaries simultaneously

### Cost Optimization
- Use cheaper models for summary generation
- Dramatically reduce token usage in long conversations
- Customize prompts for specific use cases

## When to Use Session Summaries

**✅ Perfect for:**
- Long-running customer support conversations
- Multi-day or multi-week interactions
- Conversations with 10+ turns
- Production systems where cost matters

**⚠️ Consider alternatives for:**
- Short conversations (fewer than 5 turns)
- When full detail is critical
- Real-time chat with recent context only
