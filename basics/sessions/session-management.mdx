Session management in Agno gives you control over how sessions are identified, named, and cached for optimal performance.

## Session IDs

Every session has a unique identifier (`session_id`) that tracks conversations across multiple runs:

- **Auto-generated**: If not provided, Agno generates a UUID automatically
- **Manual**: You can provide your own session IDs for custom tracking
- **Sticky**: Once set on an agent/team instance, the session_id persists across runs
- **Per-user**: Combine with `user_id` to track multiple users' sessions

<CodeGroup>
```python Agent
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
)

# Use your own session ID
agent.run("Hello", session_id="user_123_session_456")
```

```python Team
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

team = Team(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/team.db"),
)

# Use your own session ID
team.run("Hello", session_id="user_123_session_789")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Session Naming

Session names are human-readable labels that make it easier to identify and manage conversations—perfect for inbox-style UIs, support queues, or linking a conversation back to an external ticket.

### Manual Naming

Set custom names using `set_session_name()`:

<CodeGroup>
```python Agent
agent.set_session_name(session_id="session_001", session_name="Product Launch Planning")
name = agent.get_session_name(session_id="session_001")

# Or omit session_id to use the current session
agent.set_session_name(session_name="Product Discussion")
```

```python Team
team.set_session_name(session_id="session_001", session_name="Product Launch Planning")
name = team.get_session_name(session_id="session_001")

# Or omit session_id to use the current session
team.set_session_name(session_name="Product Discussion")
```
</CodeGroup>

Use the `session_id` argument when you need to rename a conversation that isn't currently "active" on the instance. Omit it to rename whichever session the agent/team is currently using.

**Tips:**
- Treat the session ID as the source of truth; names are just metadata for humans
- Rename conversations whenever the topic shifts—there's no limit on how often you call the method
- Need guardrails or naming policies? Wrap `set_session_name` in your own helper before exposing it to end-users

### Auto-generated Names

Let the AI generate meaningful names from conversation content:

<CodeGroup>
```python Agent
generated = agent.set_session_name(
    session_id="session_123",
    autogenerate=True,
)
print(generated)  # e.g. "E-commerce API Planning"
```

```python Team
generated = team.set_session_name(
    session_id="session_456",
    autogenerate=True,
)
print(generated)  # e.g. "Product Launch Strategy"
```
</CodeGroup>

Calling `set_session_name(autogenerate=True)` asks the model to read the first few messages in the session and return a short (≤5 words) label.

**Best Practices:**
- **Delay generation** until the conversation has meaningful context (e.g., after 2–3 messages)
- **Provide a fallback**: wrap the call in your own helper that falls back to a human-entered name or a ticket ID if the generation fails
- **Batch jobs**: loop over session IDs from your database and call `set_session_name(..., autogenerate=True)` once for each. The API is synchronous, so plan around model latency
- **Costs**: Each generation is an extra model call. Use cheaper models via `session_summary_manager` or run it out-of-band if you're cost sensitive

## Session Caching

Session caching stores the session object in memory to improve performance. `cache_session=True` keeps the hydrated session object in memory after the first database read, avoiding extra queries for subsequent runs.

<CodeGroup>
```python Agent
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
    session_id="my_session",
    cache_session=True,  # Enable in-memory caching
)

# First run loads from database and caches
agent.run("First message")

# Subsequent runs use cached session (faster)
agent.run("Second message")
```

```python Team
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

team = Team(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/team.db"),
    session_id="team_session",
    cache_session=True,  # Enable in-memory caching
)

# First run loads from database and caches
team.run("First message")

# Subsequent runs use cached session (faster)
team.run("Second message")
```
</CodeGroup>

### When It Helps

- **Many sequential turns** in the same session (support chats, copilots, etc.)
- **Latency-sensitive** deployments where every DB round trip matters
- **Resource-heavy databases** (remote Postgres, serverless drivers) where connection setup dominates

### Considerations

- The cache is **per Agent/Team instance**. If you spin up multiple processes, each one has its own cache
- Memory usage grows with the number of concurrent sessions held alive. Pair with eviction in your application layer if needed
- Manual edits via `get_session()` / `save_session()` automatically update the cache—no extra invalidation calls required
- For multi-node deployments, use a distributed cache (Redis, etc.) or stick with the database to keep everyone in sync

## Session Management Flow

Here's how sessions are managed across runs:

```
Run 1: Create Session
├─ Generate/use session_id
├─ Initialize session in database
└─ Return session_id

Run 2: Continue Session
├─ Provide same session_id
├─ Load session from database/cache
├─ Add new run to session
└─ Save updated session

Anytime: Manage Session
├─ Set/get session name
├─ Retrieve session state
└─ Access session metrics
```
