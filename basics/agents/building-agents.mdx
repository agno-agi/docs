To build effective agents, start simple: a model, tools, and instructions. Once that works, layer in more functionality as needed.

The key is to start with well-defined tasks like report generation, data extraction, classification, summarization, knowledge search, and document processing. These early wins help you identify what works, validate user needs, and set the stage for advanced systems.

For example, here's the simplest possible report generation agent (that uses the Hackernews toolkit):

```python hackernews_agent.py lines
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    instructions="Write a report on the topic. Output only the report.",
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("Trending startups and products.", stream=True)
```

## Run your Agent

When developing your agent, test it using the `Agent.print_response()` method. This will print the agent's response in your terminal in a readable format.

This is only for development purposes and not recommended for production use. In production, use the `Agent.run()` or `Agent.arun()` methods. For example:

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutputEvent, RunEvent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    instructions="Write a report on the topic. Output only the report.",
    markdown=True,
)

# Stream the response
stream: Iterator[RunOutputEvent] = agent.run("Trending products", stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.event == RunEvent.run_content:
        print(chunk.content)
```

## Next Steps

After getting familiarized with the basics, continue building your agent by adding functionality as needed.
