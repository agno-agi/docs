**Agents are AI programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

The core of an Agent is a model (LLM) with access to tools, guided by instructions:

- **Model:** the LLM controlling the flow of execution. It decides when to reason, use tools or respond.
- **Instructions:** prompts guiding the model on how to use tools and respond.
- **Tools:** enable Agents to take actions and interact with external systems.

With Agno, you can also equip your Agents with memory, knowledge, storage and the ability to reason:

- **Memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn and improve their responses.
- **Storage:** enables Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn conversations.
- **Knowledge:** information the Agent can **search at runtime** to provide better responses. Knowledge is stored in a vector db and this search at runtime pattern is known as **Agentic RAG** or **Agentic Search**.
- **Reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions before responding, this improves reliability and quality of responses.

## Beyond Individual Agents

Agno provides two additional core abstractions for building more complex AI systems:

- [**Team**](/concepts/teams/Overview): a collection of Agents (or sub-teams) that work together. Each team member can have different expertise, tools and instructions, allowing for specialized problem-solving approaches.

- [**Workflow**](/concepts/workflows/overview): a deterministic agentic flow defined as a series of steps. Workflows provide structured automation with predictable execution patterns, making them ideal for production systems that require reliable, repeatable processes.
