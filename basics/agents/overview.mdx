**Agents are AI programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

The core of an agent is a model that uses tools in a loop, guided by instructions.

- **Model:** Controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, respond, or use tools.
- **Instructions:** Program the model on how to use tools and respond.
- **Tools:** Enable the model to take actions and interact with external systems.

With Agno, you can also give your Agents memory, knowledge, storage, and the ability to reason:

- **Memory:** Store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing Agents to learn and improve responses.
- **Storage:** Save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless. Storage makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn conversations.
- **Knowledge:** Information the Agent can search at runtime to provide better responses. Knowledge is stored in a vector database. This pattern is known as **Agentic RAG**.
- **Reasoning:** Enables Agents to "think" and "analyze" results before responding. This improves reliability and quality of responses.

## From Agents to Multi-Agent Systems

Agno provides two higher-level abstractions for building beyond single agents:

- [**Team**](/basics/teams/overview): A collection of agents (or sub-teams) that work together. Each member can have different expertise, tools, and instructions, enabling collaboration on complex problems.

- [**Workflow**](/basics/workflows/overview): Orchestrate agents, teams, and functions through defined steps. Workflows provide structured automation and predictable behavior for repeatable tasks.
