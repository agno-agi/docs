To build effective teams, start simple -- just a model, team members, and instructions. Once that works, add more functionality as needed.

A minimal example of a team with specialized agents:

```python research_team.py
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

# Create specialized agents
news_agent = Agent(
    id="news-agent",
    name="News Agent",
    role="Get trending tech news from HackerNews",
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()]
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    id="finance-agent",
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get stock prices and financial data",
    tools=[YFinanceTools()]
)

# Create the team
team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    instructions="Coordinate with team members to research topics. Delegate to the appropriate agent based on the request."
)

team.print_response("What are the trending AI stories and how is NVDA stock doing?", stream=True)
```

<Tip>
  It is recommended to specify the `id`, `name` and the `role` fields of each team member, for better identification by the team leader when delegating requests.
  The `id` is used to identify the team member in the team and in the team leader's context.
</Tip>

<Note>
Team members inherit the `model` parameter from their parent `Team` if not specified. Members with an explicitly assigned `model` retain their own. In nested team structures, inheritance always happens from the direct parent.
Teams without a defined model default to OpenAI `gpt-4o`.

The `reasoning_model`, `parser_model`, and `output_model` must be explicitly defined for each team or team member.

See the [model inheritance example](/basics/teams/usage/other/model-inheritance).
</Note>

## Run your Team

When running your team, use the `Team.print_response()` method to print the response in the terminal.

You can pass `show_members_responses=True` to also print the responses from the team members:
```python
team.print_response("What's the latest news and weather in Tokyo?")
```

This is for development only. In production, use `Team.run()` or `Team.arun()`:

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

news_agent = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get tech news from HackerNews", tools=[HackerNewsTools()])
finance_agent = Agent(name="Finance Agent", role="Get stock data", tools=[YFinanceTools()])

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2")
)

# Run team and return the response as a variable
response = team.run("What are the top AI stories?")
# Print the response
print(response.content)

# Stream response
stream = team.run("What are the top AI stories?", stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)

# Stream and pretty print
stream = team.run("What are the top AI stories?", stream=True)
pprint_run_response(stream, markdown=True)
```

### Modify what is shown on the terminal

When using `print_response`, only the team tool calls (typically all of the delegation to members) are printed. If you want to print the responses from the members, you can use the `show_members_responses` parameter.
```python
...

team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[news_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    show_members_responses=True,
)

team.print_response("What are the top AI stories?")
```

## The Passthrough-Team Pattern

It is a common pattern to have a team that decides which member to delegate the request to, and then passes the request to the team member without any modification, and also applies no processing to the response before returning it to the user. I.e. this team is a "passthrough" team (or "router" team).

In that case the team leader is effectively bypassed and all communication is directly with a team member. See the [Passthrough Teams](/basics/teams/delegation#passthrough-teams) section for more details.
