A Team is a collection of agents (or sub-teams) that work together. The team leader delegates tasks to members based on their roles.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

team = Team(members=[
    Agent(name="English Agent", role="You answer questions in English"),
    Agent(name="Chinese Agent", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
    Team(
        name="Germanic Team",
        role="You coordinate the team members to answer questions in German and Dutch",
        members=[
            Agent(name="German Agent", role="You answer questions in German"),
            Agent(name="Dutch Agent", role="You answer questions in Dutch"),
        ],
    ),
])
```

## When to Use Teams

Use a team when:
- A task requires multiple specialized agents with different tools or expertise
- A single agent's context limit gets exceeded due to task complexity
- You want to keep each agent focused on a narrow scope

## Team Features

Teams support the same features as agents: model selection, instructions, database persistence, reasoning, knowledge, memory, and tools. See [Building Teams](/basics/teams/building-teams) for details.
