Agno supports various forms of input and output, from simple string-based interactions to structured data validation using Pydantic models. The most standard pattern is to use `str` input and `str` output.

Here's a simple example using string-based input and output:

```python basic_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
)

response = agent.run("Write movie script about a girl living in New York")
print(response.content)
```

## Structured Output

Generate validated, type-safe outputs using Pydantic models for reliable production systems. Structured outputs provide consistent, predictable response formats instead of unstructured text.

Common use cases include data extraction, classification, content generation, and validation. 

<Info>
Structured outputs work seamlessly with tools, knowledge bases, and all Agno features.

### Example

Here's an example of a structured output Agent:

```python movie_agent.py
from typing import List
from rich.pretty import pprint
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

class MovieScript(BaseModel):
    setting: str = Field(..., description="Provide a nice setting for a blockbuster movie.")
    ending: str = Field(..., description="Ending of the movie. If not available, provide a happy ending.")
    genre: str = Field(
        ..., description="Genre of the movie. If not available, select action, thriller or romantic comedy."
    )
    name: str = Field(..., description="Give a name to this movie")
    characters: List[str] = Field(..., description="Name of characters for this movie.")
    storyline: str = Field(..., description="3 sentence storyline for the movie. Make it exciting!")

# Agent that uses structured outputs
structured_output_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
    output_schema=MovieScript,
)

structured_output_agent.print_response("New York")
```

The output is an object of the `MovieScript` class, here's how it looks:

```python
MovieScript(
│   setting='In the bustling streets and iconic skyline of New York City.',
│   ending='Isabella and Alex, having narrowly escaped the clutches of the Syndicate, find themselves standing at the top of the Empire State Building. As the glow of the setting sun bathes the city, they share a victorious kiss. Newly emboldened and as an unstoppable duo, they vow to keep NYC safe from any future threats.',
│   genre='Action Thriller',
│   name='The NYC Chronicles',
│   characters=['Isabella Grant', 'Alex Chen', 'Marcus Kane', 'Detective Ellie Monroe', 'Victor Sinclair'],
│   storyline='Isabella Grant, a fearless investigative journalist, uncovers a massive conspiracy involving a powerful syndicate plotting to control New York City. Teaming up with renegade cop Alex Chen, they must race against time to expose the culprits before the city descends into chaos. Dodging danger at every turn, they fight to protect the city they love from imminent destruction.'
)
```

<Tip>
  Some LLMs are not able to generate structured output. Agno has an option to tell the model to respond as JSON. Although this is typically not as accurate as structured output, it can be useful in some cases.

  If you want to use JSON mode, you can set `use_json_mode=True` on the Agent.

  ```python
  agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
    output_schema=MovieScript,
    use_json_mode=True,
  )
  ```
</Tip>

## Structured Input

Validate inputs with type-safe Pydantic models or `TypedDict` to ensure correct data formats before processing.

You can pass a Pydantic model or dictionary as the `input` parameter in `run()` or `print_response()`.

### Example

```python structured_input.py
from typing import List

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class ResearchTopic(BaseModel):
    """Structured research topic with specific requirements"""
    topic: str
    focus_areas: List[str] = Field(description="Specific areas to focus on")
    target_audience: str = Field(description="Who this research is for")
    sources_required: int = Field(description="Number of sources needed", default=5)

hackernews_agent = Agent(
    name="Hackernews Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    role="Extract key insights and content from Hackernews posts",
)

hackernews_agent.print_response(
    input=ResearchTopic(
        topic="AI",
        focus_areas=["AI", "Machine Learning"],
        target_audience="Developers",
        sources_required=5,
    )
)
```
