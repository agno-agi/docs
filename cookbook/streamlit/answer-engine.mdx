description: Perplexity-style search with web search and deep contextual analysis.
---

Sage is a Perplexity-like Answer Engine that intelligently determines whether to perform a web search or conduct a deep analysis using ExaTools based on the user's query.

Sage:
1. Uses real-time web search (DuckDuckGo) and deep contextual analysis (ExaTools) to provide comprehensive answers
2. Intelligently selects tools based on query complexity
3. Provides an interactive Streamlit UI with session management and chat history export
4. Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq)

## Key capabilities
- Natural language query understanding and processing
- Real-time web search integration with DuckDuckGo
- Deep contextual analysis using ExaTools
- Multiple LLM provider support
- Session management using SQLite
- Chat history export
- Interactive Streamlit UI

## Simple queries to try
- "Tell me about the tariffs the US is imposing in 2025"
- "Which is a better reasoning model: o3-mini or DeepSeek R1?"
- "Tell me about Agno"
- "What are the latest trends in renewable energy?"

## Advanced analysis queries
- "Evaluate how emerging AI regulations could influence innovation"
- "Compare the environmental impact of electric vs hydrogen vehicles"
- "Analyze the global semiconductor supply chain challenges"
- "Explain the implications of quantum computing on cryptography"

## Code

The complete code is available in the [Agno repository](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/research_agent).

## Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agno.git
    cd agno
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create virtual environment">
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    pip install agno openai parallel-web
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up API keys">
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=***
    export PARALLEL_API_KEY=***
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run examples">
    ```bash
    # Fast overview research (3-5 sources)
    python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/research_agent/examples/quick_research.py

    # Comprehensive investigation (10-15 sources)
    python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/research_agent/examples/deep_research.py

    # Comparison and decision support
    python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/research_agent/examples/comparative.py

    # Automated accuracy testing
    python cookbook/01_showcase/01_agents/research_agent/examples/evaluate.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Model Selection
The application supports multiple model providers:
- OpenAI (o3-mini, gpt-5-mini)
- Anthropic (claude-3-5-sonnet)
- Google (gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
- Groq (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)

## Agent Configuration
The agent configuration is in `agents.py` and the prompts are in `prompts.py`:
- To modify prompts, update the `prompts.py` file
- To add new tools or models, update the `agents.py` file
